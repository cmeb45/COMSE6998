==Yahoo! paid inclusion controversy==
{{main|History of Yahoo!}}
In March 2004, Yahoo! launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo! search engine after payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo!

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!’s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!’s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!’s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{Main|Shi Tao}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!’s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!’s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!’s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==User-Created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles==
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!’s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo closes chat rooms over child sex concerns|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+closes+chat+rooms+over+child+sex+concerns/2100-1025_3-5759705.html|publisher=news.com|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Yahoo!

==Image search==
On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!’s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on. This was discovered by a teacher who was intending to use the service with a class to search for ""www"".  Yahoo!'s response to this was, ""Yahoo! is aware of this issue and is working to resolve it as quickly as possible"".<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo! image search exposes school to porn|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/25/yahoo_school_project/|publisher=theregister.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref>

In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao.

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!’s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!’s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==User-Created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles==
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!’s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo closes chat rooms over child sex concerns|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+closes+chat+rooms+over+child+sex+concerns/2100-1025_3-5759705.html|publisher=news.com|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Yahoo!

==Image search==
On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!’s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on.

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].

In March 2004, Yahoo! launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo! search engine after payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo!

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{Main|Shi Tao}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo!

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao.

In March 2004, Yahoo! launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo! search engine after payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo!

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{Main|Shi Tao}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{Main|Shi Tao}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==User-Created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles==
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo closes chat rooms over child sex concerns|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+closes+chat+rooms+over+child+sex+concerns/2100-1025_3-5759705.html|publisher=news.com|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Yahoo!

==Image search==
On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on. This was discovered by a teacher who was intending to use the service with a class to search for ""www"".  Yahoo!'s response to this was, ""Yahoo! is aware of this issue and is working to resolve it as quickly as possible"".<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo! image search exposes school to porn|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/25/yahoo_school_project/|publisher=theregister.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref>

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{Main|Shi Tao}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==User-Created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles==
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo closes chat rooms over child sex concerns|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+closes+chat+rooms+over+child+sex+concerns/2100-1025_3-5759705.html|publisher=news.com|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Yahoo!

On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on.

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{Main|Shi Tao}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao.

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==User-Created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles==
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo closes chat rooms over child sex concerns|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+closes+chat+rooms+over+child+sex+concerns/2100-1025_3-5759705.html|publisher=news.com|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Yahoo!

==Image search==
On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on. This was discovered by a teacher who was intending to use the service with a class to search for ""www"".  Yahoo!'s response to this was, ""Yahoo! is aware of this issue and is working to resolve it as quickly as possible"".<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo! image search exposes school to porn|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/25/yahoo_school_project/|publisher=theregister.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref>

[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA.

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

{{main|Shi Tao (journalist)}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo!

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{main|Shi Tao (journalist)}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{main|Shi Tao (journalist)}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==User-Created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles==
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo closes chat rooms over child sex concerns|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+closes+chat+rooms+over+child+sex+concerns/2100-1025_3-5759705.html|publisher=news.com|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Yahoo!

==Image search==
On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on. This was discovered by a teacher who was intending to use the service with a class to search for ""www"".  Yahoo!'s response to this was, ""Yahoo! is aware of this issue and is working to resolve it as quickly as possible"".<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo! image search exposes school to porn|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/25/yahoo_school_project/|publisher=theregister.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref>

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{main|Shi Tao (journalist)}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on.

===Outing of Chinese dissidents===

==== Shi Tao ====
{{main|Shi Tao (journalist)}}
In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story.  In April 2005, [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the [[Changsha]] Intermediate People's Court of [[Hunan Province]], [[China]] (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia [[Democracy]] Forum before the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom|url=http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html|publisher=wmd.org|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918201343/http://www.wmd.org/democracynews/dec06.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}</ref>

The [http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Verdict_Shi_Tao.pdf verdict as published by the Chinese government] stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the [[Hong Kong]] subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the [[Hunan]] newspaper that Shi Tao worked for.  Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.

In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo's Statement before the U.S. Congress|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/YahooStatement.pdf|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ([[NUJ]]) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China.<ref>{{cite news|title=British, Irish Journalists Urge Yahoo Boycott Over Chinese Cases|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198403,00.html|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2006-06-06}}</ref>

In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.""<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter Casts Doubt On Yahoo China Testimony|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/30/228254.shtml|publisher=yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Police Document Sheds Additional Light on Shi Tao Case|url=http://www.duihua.org/2007/07/police-document-sheds-additional-light.html|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing_State_Security_Bureau_Notice_of_Evidence_Collection|url=http://www.duihua.org/press/news/070725_ShiTao.pdf|publisher=duihua.org|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rights Group Says Yahoo May Have Lied to Congress|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219215406/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-31-voa18.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==User-Created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles==
As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo closes chat rooms over child sex concerns|url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo+closes+chat+rooms+over+child+sex+concerns/2100-1025_3-5759705.html|publisher=news.com|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Yahoo!

==Image search==
On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on. This was discovered by a teacher who was intending to use the service with a class to search for ""www"".

==Adware and spyware==
Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding [[spyware]] and [[adware]] — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with [[Direct Revenue]], could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Pop-Up Connection|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-07-16/yahoos-pop-up-connection|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo's Adware Counterattack|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-15/yahoos-adware-counterattack|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.

==== Li Zhi ====
{{Main|Li Zhi (dissident)}}
Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of [[dissident]] Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting [[subversion (political)|subversion]]"".

==== Wang Xiaoning ====
{{main|Wang Xiaoning}}
[[Wang Xiaoning]] is a [[China|Chinese]] [[dissident]] from [[Shenyang]] who was arrested by authorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] for publishing controversial material online.

In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chinese couple sue Yahoo in US over torture case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Independent | url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2465946.ece | location=London | first=Clifford | last=Coonan | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}</ref>  Wang Xiaoning is named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.""<ref name=""sue"">{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date=  2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}</ref>

Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in [[The Washington Post]] and many media sources:

:The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation.<ref name=""sue""/>

Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:

:In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the [[Founding Fathers]] in 1789  for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s.<ref name=""sue""/>

On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ([[email]] and [[IP address]]) with the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] that caused the [[arrests]] of writers and [[dissidents]].  The [[lawsuit]] was filed in [[San Francisco]] for [[journalists]], [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], and [[Wang Xiaoning]]. Yahoo! stated that it supported [[privacy]] and [[free expression]] for it worked with other technology companies to solve [[human rights]] concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yahoo plea over China rights case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-08-28}}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"".<ref>{{cite news|title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7081458.stm|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-25 | date=2007-11-06}}</ref>

==Image search==
On May 25, 2006, Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on.
