U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to [[The Wall Street Journal]] at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] interview by [[WIRED]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by [a] ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

To the question how he came to possess this data and are is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people.

Multiple experts that have looked into the issue believe that the security breach was the largest such incident in the [[history of the Internet]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/><ref name=Sued/>

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37447016 |title=Yahoo 'state' hackers stole data from 500 million users |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=23 September 2016 |accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to [[The Wall Street Journal]] at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] interview by [[WIRED]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by [a] ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

To the question how he came to possess this data and are is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people.

U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to [[The Wall Street Journal]] at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by [[WIRED]] via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{citenews|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by [[WIRED]] via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to [[The Wall Street Journal]] at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by [[WIRED]] via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{citenews|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] confirmed that it was investigating the affair.<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/>

==Access to the data==
As the online black market site [[TheRealDeal]] is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.
Other actors having access to this data<!--(more recent data)--> include the United States' [[NSA]] which has access to Yahoo's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] as well as by other methods. Similarly to the breach the NSA and GCHQ have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and [[Google]] [[data center]]s around the world in Britain [[Muscular (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]] program and thereby gained the ability to collect metadata and content at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts.<ref>{{cite news|title=NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA is infiltrating private networks|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/the-nsa-is-hacking-private-networks/542/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Todd Lindeman |author3=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA's MUSCULAR program collects too much data from Yahoo and Google|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsas-muscular-program-collects-too-much-data-from-yahoo-and-google/543/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Matt DeLong }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=PRISM already gave the NSA access to tech giants.

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to [[The Wall Street Journal]] at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by [[WIRED]] via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people.

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by [[WIRED]] via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{citenews|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people.

Multiple experts that have looked into the issue believe that the security breach was the largest such incident in the [[history of the Internet]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/><ref name=Sued/>

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37447016 |title=Yahoo 'state' hackers stole data from 500 million users |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=23 September 2016 |accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds: 

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{citenews|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

Multiple experts that have looked into the issue believe that the security breach was the largest such incident in the [[history of the Internet]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/><ref name=Sued/>

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18m people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]], and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] confirmed that it was investigating the affair.<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/>

==Access to the data==
As the online black market site [[TheRealDeal]] is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.
Other actors having access to this data<!--(more recent data)--> include the United States' [[NSA]] which has access to Yahoo's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] as well as by other methods.

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state-sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

Multiple experts that have looked into the issue believe that the security breach was the largest such incident in the [[history of the Internet]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/><ref name=Sued/>

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo Group|Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] confirmed that it was investigating the affair.<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/>

==Access to the data==
As the online black market site [[TheRealDeal]] is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.
Other actors having access to this data<!--(more recent data)--> include the United States' [[NSA]] which has access to Yahoo's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] as well as by other methods. Similarly to the breach the NSA and GCHQ have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and [[Google]] [[data center]]s around the world in Britain [[Muscular (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]] program and thereby gained the ability to collect metadata and content at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts.<ref>{{cite news|title=NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA is infiltrating private networks|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/the-nsa-is-hacking-private-networks/542/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Todd Lindeman |author3=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA's MUSCULAR program collects too much data from Yahoo and Google|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsas-muscular-program-collects-too-much-data-from-yahoo-and-google/543/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Matt DeLong }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=PRISM already gave the NSA access to tech giants.

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo Group|Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], plaintiff contend that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es targeting technology companies with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo Group|Comodo]] notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the hack was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] confirmed that it was investigating the affair.<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/>

==Access to the data==
As the online black market site [[TheRealDeal]] is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.
Other actors having access to this data<!--(more recent data)--> include the United States' [[NSA]] which has access to Yahoo's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] as well as by other methods.

===2012 hack===

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo Group|Comodo]] however notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' at the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs Sean Sullivan declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from [[Comodo Group|Comodo]] however notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

===2012 hack===

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[state-sponsored data breach]]es with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]] however notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===

According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy — such as the energy sector — and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[cybercriminal]] group or individual – particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]] however notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the world wide web, which makes it a good – and valid – target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[WIRED]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;– particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;– and valid&nbsp;– target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects – but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;– particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;– and valid&nbsp;– target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters.""

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;– particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;– and valid&nbsp;– target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[Instant messaging|IM]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

Other actors having access to these data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to Yahoo's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | publisher=Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=25 September 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

Other actors having access to these data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to Yahoo's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew didn't want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[PayPal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Legal and commercial responses==
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

Other actors having access to Yahoo's data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to the company's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal is under [[DDoS]] attack<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing's sale is unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
{{See also|Security breach notification laws}}
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal as of September 22, 2016 was under [[DDoS]] attack,<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

Other actors having access to Yahoo's data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to the company's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal as of September 22, 2016 was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]],<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
{{See also|Security breach notification laws}}
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal as of September 22, 2016 was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]],<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

Other actors having access to Yahoo's data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to the company's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal as of September 22, 2016 was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]],<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
{{See also|Security breach notification laws}}
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual&nbsp;— particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good&nbsp;— and valid&nbsp;— target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal as of September 22, 2016 was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]],<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

Other actors having access to Yahoo's data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to the company's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods. Similar to the breach, the NSA and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and [[Google]] [[data center]]s around the world in Britain's [[MUSCULAR (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]] program and thereby gained the ability to collect [[metadata]] and content at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts.<ref>{{cite news|title=NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA is infiltrating private networks|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/the-nsa-is-hacking-private-networks/542/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Todd Lindeman |author3=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA's MUSCULAR program collects too much data from Yahoo and Google|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsas-muscular-program-collects-too-much-data-from-yahoo-and-google/543/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Matt DeLong }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=PRISM already gave the NSA access to tech giants.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal as of September 22, 2016, was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]],<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==
{{See also|Security breach notification laws}}
The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal as of September 22, 2016, was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]],<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

Other actors having access to Yahoo's data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to the company's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods. Similar to the breach, the NSA and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and [[Google]] [[data center]]s around the world in Britain's [[MUSCULAR (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]] program and thereby gained the ability to collect [[metadata]] and content at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts.<ref>{{cite news|title=NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA is infiltrating private networks|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/the-nsa-is-hacking-private-networks/542/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Todd Lindeman |author3=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA's MUSCULAR program collects too much data from Yahoo and Google|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsas-muscular-program-collects-too-much-data-from-yahoo-and-google/543/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Matt DeLong }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=PRISM already gave the NSA access to tech giants.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia, because it was launched from computers in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

Other actors having access to Yahoo's data<!--(more recent data)--> and more include the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which has access to the company's data via the surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], as well as by other methods. Similar to the breach, the NSA and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and [[Google]] [[data center]]s around the world in Britain's [[MUSCULAR (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]] program and thereby gained the ability to collect [[metadata]] and content at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts.<ref>{{cite news|title=NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA is infiltrating private networks|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/the-nsa-is-hacking-private-networks/542/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Todd Lindeman |author3=Ashkan Soltani }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How the NSA's MUSCULAR program collects too much data from Yahoo and Google|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsas-muscular-program-collects-too-much-data-from-yahoo-and-google/543/|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Matt DeLong }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=PRISM already gave the NSA access to tech giants.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in that country.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

==Legal and commercial responses==

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach. Yahoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation.<ref name=Sued>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/news/companies/yahoo-sued-data-breach/|accessdate=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[CNN#Online|CNN]]|date=September 23, 2016|last=Larson|first=Selena|title=Yahoo facing lawsuits in the wake of massive data breach}}</ref><br/>

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in that country.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> [[Comodo Group]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in that country.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

==Attribution of responsibility and motivation==
According to Yahoo, the breach was carried out by a ""state-sponsored actor""<ref name=""y1"">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ | title=Yahoo confirms data breach affecting at least 500 million accounts | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and the organization claims that such ""intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry"".<ref name=thenat/> While Yahoo did not name any country, some suspect China or Russia to be behind the hack.<ref name=""BBC_23_Sept_2016""/><ref name=guard1>{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=China and Russia lead list of Yahoo hack suspects&nbsp;— but some doubt theory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-hack-suspects-china-russia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About 4 Million People’s Records, Officials Say|url=http://www.wsj.com/article_email/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888-lMyQjAxMTE1NjA2NDYwMzQ2Wj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> At the time of the 2014 attack, Yahoo executives were said to have concluded that it was linked to Russia because it was launched from computers in that country.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as its top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo. In one lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the plaintiffs contend that the hack caused an ""intrusion into personal financial matters."" In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/>

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

In the other lawsuit, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the plaintiff contends that Yahoo acted with [[gross negligence]] in dealing with and reporting the security breach.

The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> Yahoo in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach ""involving 30 to 40 accounts"", carried out by hackers believed to be ""working on behalf of the Russian government"" - according to Yahoo executives because it was launched from computers in that country.

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/><br/>
Arizona-based cybersecurity company [[InfoArmor]] issued a report<ref name=iareport>{{cite web|title=InfoArmor: Yahoo Data Breach Investigation|url=https://www.infoarmor.com/infoarmor-yahoo-data-breach-investigation/|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> whose conclusion challenged Yahoo's position that a nation-state actor orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts. According to the report the breach was the work of an Eastern European criminal gang who later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group and since early 2015 no longer offer to sell the full database, but are seeking ""to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money"" with the prices varying based on the value of the target. It is hard to know who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be as criminal hackers sometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire. Andrew Komarov, the firm's chief intelligence officer<!-- from Russia--> said the hackers, dubbed [[Group E (hacker group)|Group E]], have a track record of selling stolen personal data on the dark web, have been previously linked to breaches at LinkedIn, Tumblr, and MySpace<!-- and haven't been hired by anyone to hack Yahoo but simply were looking for well-known sites that had many users-->.<ref>{{cite web|title=Here's Who Hacked Yahoo, According to One Cybersecurity Firm|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/yahoo-hacked-by-eastern-european-gang-cybersecurity-firm-says/|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> The company appears to have access to portions of the Yahoo database.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> Yahoo in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach ""involving 30 to 40 accounts"", carried out by hackers believed to be ""working on behalf of the Russian government"" - according to Yahoo executives because it was launched from computers in that country. Yahoo reported the incident to the FBI in late 2014 and notified affected users.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/><br/>
Arizona-based cybersecurity company [[InfoArmor]] issued a report<ref name=iareport>{{cite web|title=InfoArmor: Yahoo Data Breach Investigation|url=https://www.infoarmor.com/infoarmor-yahoo-data-breach-investigation/|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> whose conclusion challenged Yahoo's position that a nation-state actor orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts. According to the report the breach was the work of an Eastern European criminal gang who later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group and since early 2015 no longer offer to sell the full database, but are seeking ""to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money"" with the prices varying based on the value of the target. It is hard to know who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be as [[criminal hacker]]s sometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire. Andrew Komarov, the firm's chief intelligence officer<!-- from Russia--> said the hackers, dubbed [[Group E (hacker group)|Group E]], have a track record of selling stolen personal data on the dark web, have been previously linked to breaches at LinkedIn, Tumblr, and MySpace<!-- and haven't been hired by anyone to hack Yahoo but simply were looking for well-known sites that had many users-->.<ref>{{cite web|title=Here's Who Hacked Yahoo, According to One Cybersecurity Firm|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/yahoo-hacked-by-eastern-european-gang-cybersecurity-firm-says/|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> The company appears to have access to portions of the Yahoo database.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> Yahoo in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach ""involving 30 to 40 accounts"", carried out by hackers believed to be ""working on behalf of the Russian government"" - according to Yahoo executives because it was launched from computers in that country.

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/><br/>
Arizona-based cybersecurity company [[InfoArmor]] issued a report<ref name=iareport>{{cite web|title=InfoArmor: Yahoo Data Breach Investigation|url=https://www.infoarmor.com/infoarmor-yahoo-data-breach-investigation/|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> whose conclusion challenged Yahoo's position that a nation-state actor orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts. According to the report the breach was the work of an Eastern European criminal gang who later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group and since early 2015 no longer offer to sell the full database, but are seeking ""to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money"" with the prices varying based on the value of the target. It is hard to know who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be as [[criminal hacker]]s sometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire. Andrew Komarov, the firm's chief intelligence officer<!-- from Russia--> said the hackers, dubbed [[Group E (hacker group)|Group E]], have a track record of selling stolen personal data on the dark web, have been previously linked to breaches at LinkedIn, Tumblr, and MySpace<!-- and haven't been hired by anyone to hack Yahoo but simply were looking for well-known sites that had many users-->.<ref>{{cite web|title=Here's Who Hacked Yahoo, According to One Cybersecurity Firm|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/yahoo-hacked-by-eastern-european-gang-cybersecurity-firm-says/|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> The company appears to have access to portions of the Yahoo database.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

The breach prompted two lawsuits against Yahoo.

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> Yahoo in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach ""involving 30 to 40 accounts"", carried out by hackers believed to be ""working on behalf of the Russian government"" - according to Yahoo executives because it was launched from computers in that country.

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/><br/>
Arizona-based cybersecurity company [[InfoArmor]] issued a report<ref name=iareport>{{cite web|title=InfoArmor: Yahoo Data Breach Investigation|url=https://www.infoarmor.com/infoarmor-yahoo-data-breach-investigation/|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> whose conclusion challenged Yahoo's position that a nation-state actor orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts. According to the report the breach was the work of an Eastern European criminal gang who later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group and since early 2015 no longer offer to sell the full database, but are seeking ""to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money"" with the prices varying based on the value of the target. It is hard to know who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be as [[criminal hacker]]s sometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire. Andrew Komarov, the firm's chief intelligence officer<!-- from Russia--> said the hackers, dubbed [[Group E (hacker group)|Group E]], have a track record of selling stolen personal data on the dark web, have been previously linked to breaches at LinkedIn, Tumblr, and MySpace<!-- and haven't been hired by anyone to hack Yahoo but simply were looking for well-known sites that had many users-->.<ref>{{cite web|title=Here's Who Hacked Yahoo, According to One Cybersecurity Firm|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/yahoo-hacked-by-eastern-european-gang-cybersecurity-firm-says/|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> The company appears to have access to portions of the Yahoo database.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> Yahoo in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach ""involving 30 to 40 accounts"", carried out by hackers believed to be ""working on behalf of the Russian government"" - according to Yahoo executives because it was launched from computers in that country. Yahoo reported the incident to the FBI in late 2014 and notified affected users.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/><br/>
Arizona-based cybersecurity company [[InfoArmor]] issued a report<ref name=iareport>{{cite web|title=InfoArmor: Yahoo Data Breach Investigation|url=https://www.infoarmor.com/infoarmor-yahoo-data-breach-investigation/|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> whose conclusion challenged Yahoo's position that a nation-state actor orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts. According to the report the breach was the work of an Eastern European criminal gang who later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group and since early 2015 no longer offer to sell the full database, but are seeking ""to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money"" with the prices varying based on the value of the target. It is hard to know who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be as [[criminal hacker]]s sometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire. Andrew Komarov, the firm's chief intelligence officer<!-- from Russia--> said the hackers, dubbed [[Group E (hacker group)|Group E]], have a track record of selling stolen personal data on the dark web, have been previously linked to breaches at LinkedIn, Tumblr, and MySpace<!-- and haven't been hired by anyone to hack Yahoo but simply were looking for well-known sites that had many users-->.<ref>{{cite web|title=Here's Who Hacked Yahoo, According to One Cybersecurity Firm|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/yahoo-hacked-by-eastern-european-gang-cybersecurity-firm-says/|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> The company appears to have access to portions of the Yahoo database.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to give their names to the media, highlighted similarities between the attack and previous breaches linked to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].<ref name=BBC_23_Sept_2016/> Yahoo in fall 2014 detected what it believed was a small breach ""involving 30 to 40 accounts"", carried out by hackers believed to be ""working on behalf of the Russian government"" - according to Yahoo executives because it was launched from computers in that country. Yahoo reported the incident to the FBI in late 2014 and notified affected users.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Robert|title=Yahoo Executives Detected a Hack Tied to Russia in 2014|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-executives-detected-a-hack-tied-to-russia-in-2014-1474666865|accessdate=September 25, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Sean Sullivan, security adviser at cyber security firm [[F-Secure]] Labs declares China as his top suspect and notes that ""there have been no past cases of a service provider like Yahoo being targeted [by Russia]"" whose hackers tend to perpetrate targeted attacks, either in areas important for their economy, such as the energy sector, and lately to undermine politicians, while ""China likes to vacuum up all kinds of information"" and ""has a voracious appetite for personal information"".<ref name=ft1>{{cite web|last1=Murgia|first1=Madhumita|title=Cyber experts look to usual suspects in Yahoo hack|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0e3aecaa-81b1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|work=Financial Times|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Examples of state-sponsored data breaches with China in suspicion are [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|the massive data breach]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=National Security Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> of 18 million people from the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] and the attacks on Google in 2010, dubbed [[Operation Aurora]].<ref name=ft1/>

Others have expressed doubt of Yahoo's claim of the attack being state sponsored, as it would be less embarrassing for Yahoo to attribute an attack to a nation state, which typically have the most sophisticated hacking capabilities, than to attribute it to a [[Cybercrime|cybercriminal]] group or individual—particularly as Yahoo is in the middle of being acquired by Verizon.<ref name=guard1/> Senior research scientist Kenneth Geers from  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]], however, notes that ""Yahoo is a strategic player on the World Wide Web, which makes it a good—and valid—target for nation-state intelligence collection"".<ref name=guard1/><br/>
Arizona-based cybersecurity company [[InfoArmor]] issued a report<ref name=iareport>{{cite web|title=InfoArmor: Yahoo Data Breach Investigation|url=https://www.infoarmor.com/infoarmor-yahoo-data-breach-investigation/|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> whose conclusion challenged Yahoo's position that a nation-state actor orchestrated the heist after reviewing a small sample of compromised accounts. According to the report the breach was the work of an Eastern European criminal gang who later sold the entire hacked database to at least three clients, including one state-sponsored group and since early 2015 no longer offer to sell the full database, but are seeking ""to extract something from the dump for significant amounts of money"" with the prices varying based on the value of the target. It is hard to know who the ultimate mastermind of a hack might be as [[criminal hacker]]s sometimes provide information to government intelligence agencies or offer their services for hire.

===2012 hack===
According to an interview by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' via [[Secure instant messaging|encrypted]], anonymous [[instant messaging]] with the person selling the accounts on the [[dark web]], ""Peace_of_mind"", the earlier hack in 2012 was done by a ""'team' of Russians"".<ref name=interv/><!--info on a possible even earlier hack: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3573203/Big-data-breaches-major-email-services-expert.html-->

On the question of how he came to possess this data and is only selling it now, ""Peace_of_mind"" responds:

<blockquote>Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for their own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well.</blockquote>

And to why the crew did not want to sell the whole collection earlier:

<blockquote>It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition, buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come.</blockquote>

And to the question of how he was able to make more by selling the data privately:

<blockquote>Well, [the] main use is for [[spamming]]. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse&nbsp;—as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don’t care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of [[Netflix]], [[Paypal]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc)</blockquote>

As the online black market site TheRealDeal was under [[DDoS|distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) {{as of|2016|September|22|df=US|lc=y}},<ref name=bi1/> the status of the listing was unknown.
