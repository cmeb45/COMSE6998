1,1,Oh to be stupid and smug,1,Negative
2,2,From what Ive seen it can happen at any moment Its caused by heat being fed too much power while charging as a result of bad power regulator design Basically the battery Samsung ordered from their supplier shouldnt be exploding under the heat it gets But the power regulator in the phone is failing causing the excess heat in the first place So the batteries would be 100 fine if samsung didnt fail on their end TLDR Dont charge it in your car with AC off in summer Dont charge it on your bed or any cloth Dont charge it in a hot kitchen Dont charge it anywhere that can cause it to retain heat,2,Neutral

72,72,I just called Samsung uk to tell them this not in those words exactly but since our alternative solutions to the note 7 problem are just to get a refund and a new contract I asked if theres any way an actual solution like this could happen After some talking and being left on hold while she discussed with a manager she genuinely I hope made a note on my account and said to wait for a call back It might be that they are not aware that this sort of solution would help to make the situation better for note 7 users Id advise everyone in this situation call Samsung and let them know this option of getting a replacement s7 phone and an automatic upgrade when a new model is released would convince you to stay with Samsung and return your note 7 It might at least help to make this a reality,0,Verynegative

100,100,I was wondering what was the time frame we had to exchange our phones Like theoretically use the free exchange as some sort of insurance policy Hold on to your original Note 7 until the very last day of the turn in period so just in case your phone should break in one way or another during that time frame you would basically get a new one for free,1,Negative
101,101,what,2,Neutral
102,102,He dropped it like its hot,3,Positive
103,103,Took it off to see how much I liked a caseless phone since like I said they take it back in any condition This phone is so sleek it slides out of pockets way too easily for me haha I have a case waiting on the new one,1,Negative

105,105,Im in the same boat as you and share a similar sentiment but regardless of the datedness of the S5 at this point lets be real that thing is a tank Ugly but definitely a tank,1,Negative
106,106,Probably from all the smoke,2,Neutral
107,107,If anything like that would happen it will be the S7S7 Edge They no longer manufacture the Note 5 and likely dont have enough in supply There are reports they are ramping up production on the S7S7 edge though so it may be the case,1,Negative
108,108,The S7 is seven months old and its out dated,1,Negative
109,109,I have to admit I am extremely disappointed to see Samsung tank this hard on a flagship I currently carry the S7 Edge which I LOVE but I was looking forward to upgrading to the Note 7 The bigger screen was really appealing as was the functionality of the edge without the drastic bevel,1,Negative
110,110,are you me Seriously though same exact situation I switched from the Note 3 to the pre ordered 7 decided to splurge and get the accessories came with the Gear Fit bought a wireless charging pad and Gear VR It truly is everything I want in a phone and it works with the accessories so well Now Im trying to figure out what to do,1,Negative
111,111,Note 5 isnt terrible The exynos is still no slouch even though its outdated,1,Negative
112,112,I also had a Note 7 2 months after I bought a OnePlus 3 enjoyed it for about 2 weeks and loved the sh out of it before the explosion reports Unfortunately not even the Pixel XL can compare You wont find features such as water resistance s pen and dual sim on the Pixel XL The Pixel hardware is nice but Googles default android software is so basic The Note 7 had so many features bloat added by Samsung that I really liked I am now back to using my OnePlus 3 and I dont know what to get The only thing standing between me and a Pixel or even a HTC 10 is the dual sim feature,1,Negative
113,113,March s8 ez,2,Neutral
114,114,Compared to the note 7 you have no idea Its very outdated,1,Negative
115,115,I share your sentiments exactly Nothing out there is as good as the note 7 was so Im just going to hold onto my s6 edge If the S8 impresses me Ill probably buy one of those although I will miss the S pen Its just a waiting game now,1,Negative
116,116,I agree with you Although I have a note 5 which Im surprised to say Im decently content with I finally got the wife to upgrade from her s4 and shes absolutely gutted she wants her note 7 back in a bad way and the s7 edge doesnt really cut it So Im in the same place might end up giving the kids an s7 edge when theres a note 7 replacement,1,Negative
117,117,Why not be constructive instead,1,Negative
118,118,Im definitely keeping the phone Except if they officially recall it Then the TSA could seize it at a port of entry So you know,2,Neutral
119,119,I would call it the Ford Pinto of phones,2,Neutral
120,120,My theory with the note 7 and apple 7 is that the phones have no way to cool down since theyre so air tight in order to be water proof maybe thats helping things overheat to the point that they just start to fail and poof Man Anyone know when the LG v20 is coming out,1,Negative
121,121,Same here Everything about the 7 is so much better than the note 4 Im absolutely gutted,1,Negative
122,122,Even with two recalls Id argue the note 7 to still be the best phone released this year Easy,3,Positive
123,123,Its more a matter of Samsung bricking the device at this point In my line of work when entering oil terminals they ask to see if I have a Samsung phone regardless of what version it is Youre better off biting the bullet and downgrading although its just an upgrade because youll actually be allowed to travel with your phone,1,Negative
124,124,Is there a deadline to receive refunds for the Note 7 I feel like I want to keep it until at least Spring when the new generation of phones come out,1,Negative
125,125,Im back on my Note 3 too and mourning the loss of my stupid sexy Note 7 My colleague has an S7 Edge that Ive been fondling and its close enough to the Note 7 that Ill temporarily upgrade to one After that Ill get whatever the next stylus phone is that Samsung releases later next year,1,Negative
126,126,Im able to return it for a 100 refund I had the Note 2 and Note 3 for years with no issue The only harm I have had from this is the frustration of having to return the phone twice Im sure that in two years they will have either fixed their issues or completely imploded Knowing Samsung as a company I will bet that they will have fixed their issues If you dont feel confident in them to purchase a Samsung product again I completely understand but I have found that outside of this incident their quality has been unsurpassed Then again maybe the Pixel will win me over,2,Neutral
127,127,I also gave up my Note 7 today I recommend the S7 Edge in an upgrade program like T mobile Jump On Demand,1,Negative
128,128,I bet Apple Sabotage the batteries Now theyre laughing all the way to the bank,2,Neutral
129,129,I could have ended up with one of these phones if they released a flat version its super lucky they insisted on the damn curved screen or Id be an owner,1,Negative

136,136,And its a good thing I have an extra phone that I didnt get rid of,3,Positive
137,137,Yeah this is the thing Im thinking exactly the same now Fuck Although OPs answers are pretty vague so its difficult to tell what the actual situation was if theres any chance that it was not plugged in not charging not fresh off a charge and it just randomly exploded in his hand Then it is a much bigger more scary situation than i had been led to believe,1,Negative
138,138,Any more Info or a source on that,2,Neutral
139,139,Im not entirely sure but Id put my money on before any official statement by Samsung,1,Negative
140,140,If you know your phone has a chance of over heating and exploding and you still want to use it before recall then common sense says dont put a case on it,1,Negative

154,154,If its not a note 7 its been tampered with I guarantee it,1,Negative
155,155,If its confirmed that its a stock battery its almost worse though because it shows theyre having issues with more than one model of phone Its very likely it was a 3rd party battery though,1,Negative
156,156,What was the other one,2,Neutral
157,157,Non insurance repair involves replacing the deviceAre you sure about this My friend cracked his S7 Edge a few months back and Samsung replaced the screen on his device and gave him back the exact same phone he already had,2,Neutral

159,159,WTF This is a new low even for Samsung customer service What a total fiasco this company You would think they would do all they could to help their current and loyal customers,1,Negative
160,160,When I pressed them they wouldnt give me a time frame And you think the Note7 fiasco will be over in a few weeks How long is reasonable for me to wait with a broken phone,1,Negative
161,161,Screen breakage isnt covered under warranty so 0 months,1,Negative
162,162,When they repaired my S7E they indicated that the screen and bezel edge frame is one unit Not only that but the screen is fully curved at the sides unlike any other phone that i know of which carries its own premium in labor and the manufacturing process used to make it,1,Negative
163,163,They must be real careless Dropped my S6E a few times already once even from about 1 2m above the ground No cracks at all only minor dents around the aluminium edges thats hardly noticeable I dont have a case or screen protector but either way you got to learn how to grip and take care of your phone Like if I am bringing my phone along for running I make damn well sure that my pants pocket is deep and not shallow otherwise the phone can drop out of the pocket easily,1,Negative
164,164,S7E is gon na be about 350 400 bucks as somebody in the repair industry unless theyre using knock off non OEM parts Also you guys should change up your procedure for Water Damaged phones I have gotten 4 people coming to me after taking it to you guys first because apparently all you do is put it in a humid controlled heat box for a given amount of time o o,1,Negative
165,165,exactly hopefully this really will be a temporary situation I suspect that they dont actually fix your phone they just replace it with a new one and recycle the components from the old phone into a refurbished one and maybe they are low on S7e with the Note7 mess I dont know I just cant believe theyd take this approach its like they want their stock to crash even further,0,Verynegative

182,182,Pretty crazy to see it go already I wasnt looking to get a Note 7 myself but do have a friend who upgraded from a Note 4 Not sure what his next move is I know for me Im still hoping for the Note 8 I think the only thing they can do now is taking their time and make sure whatever theyre coming up with next does not have the same faults as the Note 7 I think loyalists will be fine waiting an extra month or some than usual if it means making sure what we buy isnt exploding on us I still could see some dumb pranksters trying to keep Samsung looking bad in the future though,1,Negative

190,190,I get your mad but you are very ignorant Comparing samsung to Islamic terrorists is retarded Calling them any sort of terrorist shows you have no idea what that word means and are just saying crap Yes they rushed the phone but that wasnt the issue The issue wasnt testing the issue was that one factory fucked up the fail safes for the battery on a very small number of phones Samsung understanding the severity of the situation issued a recall and several warnings I dont know what happened with the replacement phones I dont know why some of them exploded But samsung didnt plan on it happening At least they did the smart thing and discontinued it The phones image was ruined Nothing could bring it back,1,Negative

204,204,Same I personally think the more rounded corners of the S7 edge better fit the Samsung theme as well,3,Positive
205,205,Looks like the S7 has a pink tinted AMOLED,1,Negative

253,253,There are a lot of other phones with built in batteries which are just fine,1,Negative
254,254,Yes Samsung will be fine But I dont know about their smartphone division This could really hurt them big time Everytime someone flies goes on a train ect they will hear Note7 dangerous for the next year I could easily see the Galaxy brand be permenantly hurt At that point Samsung may decide to put less emphasis and investment in the mobile division and concentrate on their chip fab Samsung may be on the same level as Sony HTC Moto ect and no longer the clear cut 1 Android brand They already lost their crown in China and this will probably lose their crown to Google in the USA,1,Negative

270,270,Im giving the iris scanner a break with it being new Usually those things get pretty buffed out in updates and when new models come out The fingerprint I would expect to be faster and of course when you have muscle memory to just do it from older phones I think once you get used to using the scanner it will be more efficient Like your muscle memory will position it right after a while and you will get used to swiping to unlock that you wont notice it as you do now with how you are just starting to use it I assume in the next models they will have a more efficient way or even with updates that will make the iris scanner faster to use than to swipe the screen I think the biggest use of it is being the security behind it I heard scanning eyes is much harder to work around than fi ngerprints for hackers,1,Negative

330,330,After my second note 7 I decided to switch to the 7 edge and if Im being honest I actually wish I got the edge to begin with Its a work of art and the perfect size and while I miss the s pen I find the edge so much more comfortable to hold and use I may switch to a pixel xl if they end up coming to ATampT but we shall see,1,Negative

379,379,If you want more of a Vanilla feel to your Samsung device download Nova Launcher and Good Lock Having owned every Nexus phone except the 6p the S7 edge is the best phone I have ever owned Tried Sony HTC LG UMI Just picked up a used Note 5 and kind of liking that also Welcome to Android where everyone hates Samsung,1,Negative
380,380,That really depends on what you are looking for in the phone If you like Samsungtouchwiz features such as pop up Windows Samsung pay wireless charging and many others plus you want a micro sd card slot then Samsung phones are better But if you prefer the stock Android feel more timely updates less noticeable lag then the pixel is better It really more preference than which is better,1,Negative

446,446,All the fanboys in the other threads defending Samsung knew nothing of corporate culture It will be interesting to see how much of a hole Samsung digs itself into,1,Negative
447,447,This isnt the first time theyve showed that they give little fucks about their customers People fangirl over new devices but forget that 1 year later those same phones are going without software updates and running old android versions Look at least years Galaxy S 6s Only just got Android 6 AFTER Android 7 came out Samsung is an awful company,1,Negative

455,455,Uh oh If they take away microSD even with a 256GB option,1,Negative
456,456,Would welcome this greatly I think they need the spec for Chinese market and just to tout they have a 256gb variant like the iPhone Id be happy with 64 or 128 plus micro SD Cant see them returning to no SD card after the s6 debacle and the sheer popularity of the s7 line,2,Neutral
457,457,it just depends on the price IMO Sometimes the price bumps for extra storage arent so outrageous and then there is Apple who is 100 for every tier Im big on SD cards myself and dont really want a phone without one if i can help it but I would pay extra for more superfast storage in addition to SD cards if its reasonable and not a gouge It would be nice to see if the S8 gets a basic storage capacity jump since iphone 7 has 32GB now,0,Verynegative

486,486,Fire sale,2,Neutral
487,487,Same Even after the recall I was excited to purchase a Note 7 If this turns out to be true then I feel morally obligated to not give Samsung any of my money for screwing up this bad,1,Negative
488,488,Alright you asked for it This is the real low light comparison S6 top S7 bottom,1,Negative
489,489,except its not the exposure lock was clearly taken in two different spots resulting in a different exposure where the S6 has blown out the highlights the only way this experiment would have been fair was to set the camera in manual mode and match the values between the two phones,1,Negative
490,490,you are correct its clearly a different exposure,2,Neutral
491,491,this isnt really a comparison of anything other than exposure,2,Neutral
492,492,as I said in a different comment please repeat the test by putting the camera on manual and match the values between the two phones or you might get different exposures like in the photo you did,2,Neutral
493,493,I got ta say one thing The glass over my note 5 and s6 are terrible at getting oil on them Every time I go to take a picture I have to wipe off the glass or itll look like the photo here What Im getting at is o think the s6 had an oily film over the glass when this was taken because thats how mine looks when it has oil on it,1,Negative
494,494,I got mine today Holy crap the camera is amazing in low light and its crispy af outside,1,Negative
495,495,I heard that exposure was different on the two phones The first shots was everything on the default settings This shot is where the exposure has been set to the lowest S7 top S6 bottom,2,Neutral
496,496,To be honest stereo speakers are not on my list to improve Got a s6 and while I would like an improvement on that one speaker stereo isnt a big deal I only use it for YouTube or other short video for music I use ear plugs wired or bt speakers If they can fit descent stereo speakers without removing anything sure why not but I wouldnt want to swap anything present right now for them,1,Negative
497,497,Samsung wont add those because theyre useless Who cares about that kind of speakers when you have a audio jack or Bluetooth speekers Besides who the hell listens to music directly from the phones,1,Negative
498,498,How are stereo speakers that are 18 big and an inch apart any kind of improvement If one wants stereo from a phone youre using headphones anyway,1,Negative
499,499,Theyve listened to consumers for the last few years They brought back micro SD card support water resistance they made the phone thicker for a bigger battery and slimmed down TouchWiz As long as they continue to listen to consumers and think rationally I think theyll keep the headphone jack,1,Negative
500,500,I just hope they use Samsung processors instead of Qualcomm for every model like the s6,2,Neutral
501,501,Yeah if theyre going to improve audio quality Id rather they do it in a way that actually makes a difference I e DAC Phone speakers are going to sound like absolute tinny garbage even if there are two of them,1,Negative
502,502,My S8 hopes 1 Dont be afraid to make it slightly thicker for a larger battery Seriously if companies like Xiaomi can have a 4050mAh battery for their own Note phones that cost much less Samsung should go all out No one buys phone X because its 0 7mm thinner than phone Y 2 More reduction of bloatware I cant stand redundant apps like Camera amp Magnifier For other apps that hardly people ever use like S Health or Samsung Gear DO NOT pre install them If they need apps to sync with other devices like the Samsung smartwatch let them download them upon syncing rather than pre installing them 3 One up Apple further by setting a default 64GB storage 4 The default apps amp settings visuals should take more cue from the Black Theme darker colors so less battery life is being consumed Sure consumers can manually change to the all black theme but the average general public are somewhat too dumb for that I have a handful of relativesfriends who dont know about this5 Yes dual cameras nuff said 6 4GB RAM and disable the loading animations You can manually do them in Developer Mode but again how much do the general public know Of course all that and VR performance and non exploding batteries would be enough to knock Apple of its spot,1,Negative
503,503,apple is garbagio mang,2,Neutral
504,504,Im going to be so disappointed in Samsung if they remove the headphone jack If thats the case I would just keep my s7,1,Negative
505,505,stereo speakers plz no i will literally never use it,1,Negative
506,506,They should work on keeping the phone from exploding and catching fire before worrying about speakers haha,2,Neutral
507,507,As far as Im concerned Samsungs brand has been permanently tarnished and I will not be buying a Samsung phone for the foreseeable future Their handling of this disaster has been breathtakingly callous and stupid,1,Negative
508,508,That dude that breathed all that black smoke might get cancer and die decades earlier than he should Hope he gets MILLIONS from Samsung Look all companies make mistakes But making the same mistake that can cost peoples lives is almost unforgivable,1,Negative
509,509,Cheap ass phones,2,Neutral
510,510,In the same boat here Already gotten a few people Ive run into make comments like sure it wont explode etc the s7 appears to be tarnished where I live because of this as well It doesnt matter if you tell them its a different line of phone To many people I meet Samsung now equals boom,1,Negative
511,511,Well the device has to be on in order for current to flow an the issue is something in the phone is heating up too much and causes failure I assume theres too much current being drawn by the part that fails and either the battery cant handle it or the part gets so hot the battery fails and erupts,1,Negative
512,512,Probably will be permanent Theres no 3 strike rule here I love Samsung products but this wasnt good If carriers wont even sell them its a death sentence for sure I have the S7 Edge and its been great Not sure why this Note 7 has been such a disaster The Note is usually very renowned because it has the best features of the Galaxy S in a bigger form factor and more refined software The Note 7 is still that but clearly there was an issue in manufacturing and possibly even engineering in the battery,1,Negative
513,513,I do have insurance on the phone I doubt Verizon will warranty this under their 14 day policy though The phone works fine 100 and the drop really wasnt that bad There was no damage done to the side trim and the case covers the back now Ill just wait until something catastrophic happens before putting in a claim at this point,1,Negative

520,520,Yeah Im glad mine smacked the rear Im assuming mine only cracked since I heard the back glass isnt as strong,1,Negative
521,521,That phone is too expensive not to have a case on it If that were my phone I would activate the phone and leave it in the box until my case came in Good luck on whatever you decide to do,1,Negative
522,522,Go to a Verizon company store Ask the manager if you can do an emergency in store insurance claim They will call Asurion who will pay the store for the phone after they have collected your deductible That way you immediately get a brand new phone If you wait you risk getting a refurbished replacement,1,Negative
523,523,Dude what happened,2,Neutral
524,524,Well thats a Q40 which make 328hpHow fast were you going I doubt the magnet would hold up under heavy acceleration holding on to a large phone,1,Negative

527,527,Its not the cost of the case its the look of the phone that makes people go without them,2,Neutral
528,528,Thats a real pity its scary how these glass phones are so fragile Style over function I never really trusted those magnet systems especially with heavy phones Bit off topic but I tried a ridiculous amount of car holders and they all had issues A friend gave me a 1 holder and Ive had it for two years sometimes simple works best It looks a lot like this one,1,Negative
529,529,First option caseSecond option insurance Dont leave your note 7 uncovered,2,Neutral
530,530,Makes me cringe very sorry to hear,1,Negative
531,531,If you purchased it with a credit card a lot of companies will cover accidental damage in the first 30 90 days Should go check Its called buyers protection I think,1,Negative
532,532,I had the same thing happen after the 2nd day AFTER I took off a case because it was too rubbery sigh,1,Negative
533,533,Man just when I think it cant get worse than ATampT I read about the other carriers,1,Negative
534,534,They did the same thing with the S5 I currently have It was missing a lot or features The 3 I readily recall because I used them a lot on my Tmobile phones was scheduling messages the spam folder for texts and download booster All missing on Verizon,1,Negative
535,535,US Carriers are fucked up That would be completely unacceptable in most of Europe Why are Samsung even letting them do those changes,1,Negative
536,536,It really is the best phone that Ive ever held But like you said Verizon screwed with the software in a disgusting way Just leave things alone I want to leave Verizon badly but my wife isnt interested in leaving,1,Negative
537,537,Has it impacted Verizons sales to a noticeable degree Clearly it is OK,1,Negative
538,538,Good ol verizon,3,Positive
539,539,What do you mean by alternative I may have a recommendation for you,3,Positive
540,540,Because theres a large market segment that will only buy an iphone no matter what This is why Apple can release a phone in 2016 with a dual core CPU and still get sales This is Samsungs way to earn revenue from that segement,1,Negative
541,541,My phone is all glass Note 5 and rocked it naked since the day Ive opened it A couple of small knicks but not much more than what I got with a case on my last phone,1,Negative

556,556,1 If they had left a removable battery none of this recall b s would be going on We would all be getting new batteries 2 They have not released any specific information about what the triggers are for the explosions 3 All phones that use lithium ion batteries have the potential to explode the other companies have better PR teams than samsung and can keep a lid on it when this happens 4 The number of phones with issues VS The number released is ridiculously low statistically it makes no sense to have killed a good phone when they cant even replicate the explosions themselves Was it something that happened to the phone earlier that day Was the person using the extra adapter to charge the phone Was it laying in the sun or near heat in the past 24 hours There are to many variable for them to do this The whole thing has been a night mare and those of that have been through the whole debacle twice Will expect them to cough up more the 100,1,Negative

559,559,You obviously dont know how big of a company samsung is to think 3 bill out the window would shut it down lol,1,Negative
560,560,Just think about how much Samsung couldve raised profit out of note 7 and other future product in the future Its not just 3 million dollars Because note 7 ruined image of Samsung the every new product Samsung make in the future will not be sold as good as before the explosion Poor Samsung,1,Negative
561,561,There are a few things wrong with this Firstly Im sure they dont make absolutely every phone initially so I dont know maybe 10 million phones After that you have to consider the phones actual cost to make which is not any more than 300 and that ends up totalling to at most 3 billion which supports this article,1,Negative
562,562,A story this damning should spell the end of their practices This is a government and private corporation colluding to cover the truth to protect seemingly competitive advantage Its absolutely deplorable any way you look at it And for what To fuel our desire to get devices to lock us into playing Pokemon Go on prettier AMOLED screens What a fucking joke,1,Negative
563,563,I think its really interesting to note the difference in traction on two different subs for this same story On this sub a sub dedicated to Samsung knowledge announcements and products we have a humble forty plus upvotes On world news this story exploded with over 6 5k upvotes Wtf Is there just a lot of nepotism in this sub or a lack of empathy I dont get it,1,Negative

571,571,Thats my first thought Weve seen some companies have put mammoth batteries but if theres one thing thats always taken a while to adopt is large storage 32GB should have been standard many years ago but its only become that since like last year 8GB and 16GB phones are still common in fact especially on the iPhone I honestly dont even care about microSD if the internal storage is huge like 128GB or more Its a faster technology and it rules out errors from a badcheap microSD one of the thing thats impressive is the water resistance without flaps like the S5 Wonder if they can do the same with the S Pen on the Note 6,1,Negative

575,575,The S3 has MST which grants it the same functionality as Samsung pay on a normal phone Some videos around YouTube have also demonstrated it being used on both versions of the S3 so itll be there on launch Though there is some conflicting information Somewhere I read that the watch can only handle 5 purchases by itself without being connected to a galaxy phone Once connected it can do as many as you want and will be reloaded to 5 if the phone is disconnected Yet their graphic shows that full functionality of Samsung pay is available If somebody is buying this for the MST and doesnt have a galaxy phone they should wait for reviews,1,Negative

725,725,Of course its possible Look at the first version of the Note 7 They pushed out an update that prevented it from charging above 60 percent Then the Gear VR pushed out an update to prevent the Note 7 from being able to be used in the device No reason that they cant completely cripple it Then theres an even easier route Simply ban all Note 7 IMEIs from carrier networks In other words blacklist them all just like they would if it was a stolen phone For liability purposes you would think that at some point they almost have to do that Somewhere out there you could in theory have someone who doesnt know about a recall The easiest way to reach that person is to block their phone from the network Then when they call or go to a store to see the problem they will learn about the recall,2,Neutral

764,764,Sounds like you need to contact Samsung and file a claim with USPS or FedEx Either someone stole your packages or they were delivered to the wrong address For the last promo FedEx delivered my wireless chargers to my next door neighbors door step so check with your neighbors and be sure to file a complaint if they delivered to the wrong address,1,Negative
765,765,I see theyve fancied it up since I got one last year for my Note5 That one just came in a plastic bag,3,Positive
766,766,Man I signed up for that promotion and it said out of stock I bought a 10 dollar one from Amazon So at least thats something,1,Negative
767,767,50 off isnt even a great deal some people were under the impression it was going to be nearly freeDunno about korea but pretty much anywhere else you can sell a year old phone for at least half the value which is essentially what theyre offering as compensation for a major fuck upHere in Canada the S7E has a trade in value of 325 currently with every new flagship release they have a 150 200 discount if you trade in a phone and that combines with the trade in value of your phone so thats a 525 discount if the value doesnt dropUnless I misinterpreted the offer and you dont have to trade in your phone then its still pretty ass since youll have to sell it anyway if youre getting a new phone,1,Negative
768,768,cool story,3,Positive
769,769,Very disappointed its not for everyone still using Samsung devices and Im on an Edge plan with Verizon,1,Negative
770,770,I went with an S7 Edge and Im actually not too torn with the direction theyre taking this I mean they are giving us Samsung loyalists for lack of a better term 50 the newest phone via trade in Depending on when they release it if its less than a year from now you wouldnt have paid 50 of your phone off by then I know people will argue that its not enough for our troubles but its a lot better than nothing at all,1,Negative
771,771,I had the exact opposite experience Sprint wouldnt give me a refund on my note 7 they would only exchange it for a phone I didnt want I contacted Samsung and they sent me a return kit to get a full refund on the device,1,Negative

786,787,I cant say never but Ill definitely be taking a break from Samsung with the Pixel XL Maybe in a year or two Ill reevaluate after I see how Samsung has handled things and what direction Google is headed with their project,3,Positive
787,788,I dont buy it 90 of Note 7 owners got replacement Note 7s with the first recall And your title is wrong The online survey was done among Samsung phone owners not Note 7 owners It likely captures a bunch of clueless consumers who dont actually have Samsung phones,1,Negative
788,789,Theres a difference between what someone says in a survey during a period of heightened negativity towards Samsung and what they do in a year or two when they release a new phone that everyone is raving about,2,Neutral
789,790,These survey dont mean shit when youre only surveying a very small percentage of Note 7 owners,1,Negative
790,791,A survey of 1000 people doesnt say much,2,Neutral
791,792,Im taking a long break from them The note 7 was the first phone Samsung made that I really liked I have no interest in the s7 or s7e and I doubt Ill have any interest in any of their phones for awhile,1,Negative
792,793,No just a very very very small of those devices 3 4 failures per million is 6 sigma the problem is that they dont know where it is failing Since they cant reproduce the failure,0,Verynegative

810,811,TLDR Is Samsung really replacing handsets Got my phone back and the displayed battery life dropped dramatically after update So I just got my note 7 shipped to me today Went online and confirmed via the MEI number and everything Weird thing though The battery power was at 43 when I started the software update After updating the green battery icon appeared and now my battery life stood at 25 Im betting Samsung just flashed new software in all the replacement units and sent them right back out the door Their fix for those who had not yet replaced their phones was a software update that would not allow the phone to be charged above 60 of capacity,1,Negative
811,812,The iPhone 7 is a marketing disaster with the jack gone and as always with apple no goddamn important new feature except that its a cheap cashgrab as always with apple and the Note 7 literally a safety hazard I guess youre right,1,Negative

819,820,My girlfriend has the S5 and personally I like it a lot more then the S6 Where as the S6 does have its pros I think it tried to be to much like an iPhone and strip away some of its key features that made is a galaxy,1,Negative
820,821,Id also wish for a device that was CIT customer interface test tested and with an IMEI that can be linked to the date of manufacturing Since my first S5 wasnt CIT tested and the IMEI for my Tab S says it was manufactured 43 days after I purchased it,1,Negative

837,838,Hitachi is normally my go to for storage but I just replaced a four year old Seagate 750 GB HDD primary drive in a VAIO with a Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SSD Also have a Hitachi 1TB internally as secondary Couldnt be happier after fixing Windows Update Definitely worth it I probably restarted thirty times today Not one boot and log in took more than five or ten seconds I spent more time typing my password than it spent booting,0,Verynegative

841,842,Put S7 in shopping cart,2,Neutral
842,843,True no heart rate sensor and not as round as the other pictures,1,Negative
843,844,Its because the S6 is very thin and until Samsung recently came up with a new thinner camera sensor this is all they had to work with They werent about to sacrifice the camera quality so they made the camera protrude a bit,1,Negative
844,845,Good news hopefully cases covers wont cause edge shadow when taking photos,3,Positive

846,847,Like you said it is in a demo mode so I cant do everything you can to a regular phone I will say that menus are the snappier I honestly am reminded of my old iPhone back when they were king Ive only had one bad lag issue but that was after forcing the phone to exit the demo video The black is very nice and I hate black phones Havent seen the silver but thatll be the one I get,1,Negative
847,848,Had a YUUUUGE lag issue after leaving the Note 7 demo video where the phone froze for a solid 5 seconds But that happens on all other Samsungs demos So I wouldnt worry about that I almost forgot the edge was there Much nicer than the S7E where Id constantly hit the edge Fits in my hand better too Lot more natural,1,Negative
848,849,The edge is MUCH tighter As somebody who despised the edge I really like it As far as feeling the Note feels very Sturdy Comfortable to hold and use My manager is going to upgrade from his S7E he got like 2 months ago,1,Negative

852,853,No complaints from me I played a song off Youtube Katy Perry I think and it was pretty clear Bit louder than my Note 5 I actually think the S7E was the loudest out of the three Not all heroes wear capes Some just choose to play with phones while theyre bored,0,Verynegative
853,854,How is the sound quality with headphones Also do you think its worth the upgrade from a Note 5,2,Neutral
854,855,Someone told me the sound was better on the Note 7 over the S7 Edge or S7 but you said it is not as loud Can you double check it Also wonder how the battery life is but I know you can not test it because it is always plugged in,1,Negative
855,856,Unfortunately I cant set a lock up due to the demo security features I did do the iris scanner demo and it worked great Take it with a HUGE grain of salt though Im guessing you mean if Im accidentally hitting the edge like what happens with the S7E I havent done that once at all The edges are much tighter and not as prominent,1,Negative
856,857,It requires the new USB C gearvr which hasnt shipped yet,1,Negative

859,860,Not OP but I also played with a demo Note Its still plastic but it doesnt feel awful and cheap to me,1,Negative
860,861,No clue As a demo device Samsung security doesnt let me power the device off or reset,1,Negative
861,862,Should be able to Ill test in a secondEdit Looks like our store pair of headphones are MIA Ill try to remember to bring my own to test it As far as the S Pen I feel like it got a well needed face lift Much more precise and I can see myself using it for quicker note more often,3,Positive
862,863,does it have sd card integration or do you have to move apps to sd,2,Neutral
863,864,I hope this is true I passed on the S 6 and Note 5 because of this,2,Neutral

869,870,I used one of the first 14 3 Full HD chrome book 2s I thought chrome os looked like shit Unless they can figure out scaling its windows all over again isnt it That said about damn fucking time something like this makes the market,1,Negative
870,871,Same thought Samsung nailed whole curve screen thing with Note 7 They finally got a perfect balance between look and functionality,3,Positive
871,872,Yes S6 Edge had their share of problems but you should try Note 7s curve its definitely problem free,1,Negative
872,873,That edge was very big,3,Positive
873,874,I brought back my S6 edge plus the day after I got it because of this Completely unusable without a case Gambled and got a S7 Edge after that It was still a bit annoying But I could use it with no case just had random letters tossed in my sentences sometimes Have a note 7 now Works amazing with no case The edge is perfect,3,Positive
874,875,I have an S6E and and as the phone is beginning to rapidly age and get ready to go out to pasture I have to say I enjoy the edge It looks nice and I find gripping it with a case more natural than a slate phone,1,Negative
875,876,Curve on the back flat for the screen 1 Same benefits maybe better because more ergonomic like smaller easier to handle and more comfortable 2 Less accidental touches when reaching across with your thumb or holding the phone landscape the drop down menu always seems to trigger when I watch things,1,Negative
876,877,Its not perfect but I like it,1,Negative

882,883,Absolutely After recently switching from iOS to Android I love stock Android MUCH more than TouchWiz or Tizen for that matter I would not get another Samsung With that said I am REALLY loving Good Lock and Samsungs Themes With these and Package Disabler Pro Im actually at a sweet spot right now that Im VERY happy with my S6 except battery life REALLY cant wait for the new Note,1,Negative
883,884,Yeah I wish I could just get android wear on my gear s but when I look into it its all forum posts of people telling people asking that its stupid because the tizen is allows features like calling but honestly the barren app store stops me from bothering to charge the watch at all at least android wear has 3rd party support Oh and s voice is the worst voice command platform I have ever used,0,Verynegative
884,885,As nice and well built as my S7edge is the most important feature is that its an android phone Apple makes well built phones and Im sure Nokia does too But I dont like iOS or Windows phone and wouldnt buy them no matter how great the hardware is Id go Nexus or Oneplus if samsung abandoned android,1,Negative
885,886,Im not going to a barren ecosystem run by a company that would charge huge prices for even crappy apps Id switch phone brands immediately,1,Negative

890,891,Why would you dump Android I just bought the S7 Edge and Im running as close to stock android as I can I deleted or disabled as many samsung or 3rd parties apps as I could The smart idea would to run stock android and the google launcher and dump touch wiz or wiz home whatever its called Samsung hardware and Android software thats the key,1,Negative
891,892,Yup I wouldnt buy a Samsung phone without Android Id probably switch to a Nexus,1,Negative
892,893,I wouldnt care because I wouldnt be buying another device from them If they really go this way it will be a total shit show,1,Negative

894,895,No more Samsung phones for me then,2,Neutral
895,896,Agreed I have so much information tied to Google at this point that switching would be a giant pain in the ass All of my 2 step verifications lay through Google my maps reviews and so much more is with Google,1,Negative
896,897,Anyone here that says Tizen is bad because of the wearable version is really uninformed Tizen runs in so many Samsung devices and the central point of focus is usually the same advanced tech that is simple for the user and opens doors for mobile that have not been touched yet Samsung with android is nice but they havent scratched the surface with what they are capable of yet The day that Samsung releases a Tizen based mobile device is the beginning of the end for IOS,1,Negative
897,898,I got a Windows phone when Windows Phone 8 came out That was by far the best phone experience I have ever had Not perfect nothing is but a true joy to use on a daily basis Then 8 1 came out It introduced some good improvements but took away some of the best parts of 8 0 Then I installed the preview for 10 which was a huge POS in my opinion Came back to Android after that I still lament the direction MS went with Windows Phone and what could have been,1,Negative
898,899,I value Samsung brand name too much to not freak out I bought a sub par for price J5 against other competition simply because I didnt trust their after sales service,1,Negative

904,905,Theres not even enough room for 3,1,Negative
905,906,One way ticket to lose their market share I would switch to the Nexus then,1,Negative
906,907,It looks like HTC is finally turning things around This would be a great time to go back In a way I hope Samsung does as this should spell the end of Tizen and we can one day hope to see Samsung Android Wear watches hit the market Edit grammar,1,Negative
907,908,As much as I think Samsung makes good phones not really Id probably just get an HTC,1,Negative
908,909,Thats why Google sold Motorola to Lenovo to keep Samsung happy If they were going to attempt this they should have done it years ago,1,Negative
909,910,If this meant what it currently means for my S Gear 2 piss poor app selection laughably bad voice recognition from S Voice no Google Now or Google apps integration then off to Nexus and Android Wear I go,1,Negative

913,914,I want Google Android more than I want samsung,1,Negative
914,915,I love Andoid OSSoftware way more than Samsung HardwareDesign If Samsung drops Android then my next upgrade would be too the next best Android device after that I litterally cant imagine owning a cellphone tablet without the Google Play Store,2,Neutral
915,916,at first probably not but to be 100 hones if samsung does good with tizen and makes it actual competition for android or IOS then i would consider it,2,Neutral
916,917,My first one got very hot and would lag so bad,2,Neutral
917,918,That color is so pretty Anyways if a reboot didnt fix it then the flex cable is probably just partially lifted Quick fix if you have the tools otherwise just bring it into a repair shop,1,Negative
918,919,Ded,2,Neutral
919,920,rglitch art,3,Positive
920,921,When I overclocked my phone to 2 3 Ghz on core and 800 Mhz GPU this happened to me once I unlocked my phone One restart later and it worked properly In rest I didnt OC it anymore and it works properly now,3,Positive

924,925,MST wasnt available on the S2 and the addition of it on any Android phone is a huge bonus Youve just upgraded your phone to pay for stuff on just about any magnetic card reader,1,Negative
925,926,Seems a bit crazy that their brand new product is getting a Black Friday sale,1,Negative
926,927,I would definitely say so yes I had the S2 since release these new designs and features makes me wan na upgrade Though its really up to your wrist size,1,Negative
927,928,The S3 had some minor UI and software tweaks Will those make their way to the S2 Classic I have no need for the new features and the S3 is a bit too big i think,1,Negative
928,929,Theres a beta for the iOS right now as far as the Gear Manager goes Pretty soon im sure theyll release the final product,1,Negative
929,930,Well as far as inbox and hangouts you wont get a separate app available on tizrn you simply get notifications and can reply to them As far as google now unfortunately the tizen os forces you to use s voice Its kinda awkward anyways to talk to your watch rather than just your phone As far as experience difference just expect less app selection for tizen Its still a good os for the watch though very smooth,1,Negative
930,931,Im a big screen person so Im HYPED I was hoping theyd make AN S2 with a bigger screen but this is even better As a Nexus 6 owner and now a Note7GS2 owner Yessss Plz,1,Negative
931,932,Tizen honestly isnt bad Been using my Gear S2 with no problem Only gripe i have is the lack of variety of apps thats it,1,Negative
932,933,Ikr Though the pricing im concerned about since it looks rugged and has sporty features I hope its not as expensive as the Garmin Fenix 3 which is around 500 or hopefully it doesnt get as expensive as 400,1,Negative
933,934,Im relieved I already spent 880 because there was a phone that was slightly better than mine I didnt want to pony another 350 for a watch My beloved S2 is safe looking all svelte on my wrist,1,Negative

935,936,LOVE the IR blaster on the note 4 they better include it in the 7,1,Negative
936,937,Its a flat screen variant Lots of people including myself dont want an edge version,1,Negative
937,938,Pure marketing and probably a good idea The S7s are out and appear to be on an annual release cycle now with the Note The iPhone 7 is likely around the corner They dont want an uninformed consumer to think that the Note 6 means previous generation,3,Positive
938,939,Hello beautiful Come here often,3,Positive
939,940,Agree,2,Neutral
940,941,While I love my Note 2 especially with the Note 4 based Eclipse v8 rom I really looking forward to upgrading to the Note 7 or S7 edge even though Im not sure I the edge variant actually makes sense for me,2,Neutral

944,945,If this is truly it bye bye my note 4,2,Neutral
945,946,Its really difficult to protect with a casescreen protector because the need to access the bottom of the curve Plus it is more likely to break than a flat screen,1,Negative

225,1225,Of course the brand is damaged its definitely not pre exploding loyalty The question is how much is it damaged by the recall which this poll doesnt answer,1,Negative
226,1226,Im a T mobile rep and I believe it did hurt the Samsung brand a bit Most of the time I recommend an S7 or S7E customers ask me if thats the exploding phone Sometimes people just come in and ask if we are still selling the exploding phone As a Samsung fan it does kind of annoy me since people arent aware of how good these devices are,1,Negative

270,1270,Im fairly certain this is a non edge prototype rather than the final one Especially when you have a look at the charging port on the bottom Im pretty sure a definite USB type c charger would have a USB c shaped port not micro USB with USB c behind This suggests to me this was a test body with a USB c put behind the micro USB port,1,Negative

288,1288,I was literally just coming to market for a S7 edge and this pops up will be picking one of these up for sure,3,Positive
289,1289,All they need to do now is to have a good purchase plan and protection plans and this is how smartphones should be sold Good going Samsung,1,Negative

295,1295,This is good to know Its sad to see that a tech company would to allow themselves to interfere with the user experience in such an intrusive way This only sets a precedent that may continue to be followed well into the future Smart TVs just sound like a hindrance when I can so easily replicate and surpass the experience offered by Smart TVs by simply buying a substantially cheaper high resolution non Smart TV and slapping a Chromecast on it On a side note I find it funny that the site hosting this article employs some pretty annoying and intrusive ads as well,1,Negative

305,1305,You know Oculus did update just the other day The only other thing outside the normal was a small drop from waist height yesterday But 1 the drop was inside and on a wood floor phone in case landed screen down and 2 pretty sure drops like this should not affect the battery I will try this and report back thanks,1,Negative

310,1310,Honestly had the same exact same thoughts Was really concerned that the phone itself or the battery was having some issue and I was going to need either a new model or to change devices Ill try to uninstall the Oculus app and see if that works,1,Negative
311,1311,Uninstall oculus worked to fix battery drain issue Not sure if its related but my keyboard keeps hiding while Im in the middleof typing anyone else having this issue S7 edge VZW,1,Negative
312,1312,Glad I read this mine also started this a day or so ago And I did notice an Oculus app update I was also having weird issues with my S2 Gear Classic Wouldnt connect but my Pebble worked fine,1,Negative

314,1314,Im in Idaho and went in to my local Best Buy to see about the exchange The Best Buy rep told me that they have Note 7s in stock but are waiting for Samsung to unlock them I was able to preorder one and will receive an email when mine is available He said most likely it would be around the 21st of September,1,Negative

329,1329,This is because USB C cables are reversible EDIT The ridges are to help identify which side of the USB cable is up so that you can essentially plug in the micro USB cable into your phone without much effort As USB C cables can go in either way the design of the ridges are no longer needed Would look pretty weird with ridges on both sides and having it on one side would habituate people into plugging in USB C cables only one way,1,Negative
330,1330,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you may have the USB 3 speeds On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere And none of those will work on the new phone However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier,1,Negative
331,1331,Fine by me as long as it has wireless charging Its nice having a bunch of micro usb cords around but I use them for what they are for Headphones xbox one controller etc etc So I really only have one cord and that is what came in the box,1,Negative

424,1424,Luckily I noticed this issue the first time I stuck it to the mount so I dont know about prolonged use The fact that the S Pen doesnt work on the magnetized area was enough for me to pull it off and be done with it The screen works as intended now,1,Negative

434,1434,My credit union was added but I use big bank credit cards anyway Honestly most of the people who complain about their banks not being supported should just get a credit card from a bank that is I dont know if there are many people who realize the advantages of using credit cards over debit cards Especially for fraudulent charges It can take weeks or months to get your money back if someone fraudulently uses your debit card but one phone call reverses a fraudulent charge on a credit card,1,Negative

462,1463,I hope Samsung is going to continue to support S2 Classics since I have one There is no reason why they should abandon them except for wanton greed Stand by the product and keep customers These watches are not inexpensive I would probably buy the S5 once it comes around if the features are so much better But if they fail to update the ware on my S2 I am going to think twice,1,Negative

472,1473,SpeninfraredirisscannngvrheadsetSuperhdscreenMotherfuckas,2,Neutral
473,1474,I mean if you buy a device on a payment plan it means that you have to buy the device entirely and not get a discount on it Meanwhile if you sign a 2 year contract I can get 550 off on the device for agreeing to stay with the carrier for 2 years Since the device payment plan breaks it down over 24 months anyways isnt it beneficial to buy it under a 2 year contract I honestly dont care if I get locked down for two years unless hidden fees applyAlso I do know that T mobile has more perks but they dont have 2 year contracts According to my logic above wouldnt it be beneficial to stay with VZW Also my parents are with Verizon so we can get the 4 lines for 150 deal which is actually pretty sweet My parents just hate the idea of having to leave a carrier theyve been with for 10 years,1,Negative
474,1475,Coming from a GN5 I would LOVE the s pen but idk Being a teen I can really benefit from having a phone asap But that 4x4MIMO is also very sexy,1,Negative
475,1476,I would do the Note in all honesty Its still an amazing phone However I have to wait til September to get mine I have a striking feeling they may come up with a more advanced version with how they are currently in other countries So the wait may be worth it but you need it now If I were you I would figure out what I want and what the most important things are in a phone you want Then check off any pros and cons with each version until you settle with what has the better features for you I feel the Note 7 will offer more especially with the extra features it has Plus if you make a habit out of using the pen you may grow addicted to using it I forced myself to use it after not using it for a year That whole year I feel like I missed out on its full potential and ever since I have never gone a day without using the pen Its incredibly useful for what I do and I dont think I could be any more efficient with an S series phone than the Notes Especially with how much they expanded on the pen features I am excited to get the N7,1,Negative
476,1477,S pen is awesome in using it right now to type this message Browsing around with the pen is tight as hell too,3,Positive
477,1478,I dont know why you are being down voted either I also hope that this one is black like the s7 is I own an s6 edge and youre right its more of a dark blue which doesnt bother me but I would rather have a black phone,1,Negative

479,1480,Id REALLY hoped for a flat model but I guess I dont mind this render It looks as though the edges are toned down compared to the S7 edge,1,Negative

530,1531,I honestly dont understand why they would do it for the Note line I feel what separates the Note line for the S is the productivity The Note is geared towards productivity while the S is full of the fancy gimmicks I dont see how having edges will add productivity especially if it makes it more difficult to navigate with the stylus,1,Negative

650,1651,It looks like the design might be taking a Note 5S6 approach where the flat side of the phone is opposite between the two That being said I cant say the thin frame all around the phone has much appeal I like the previous design where it stays thin on the sides and larger on the top and bottom Gives the curved glass side a nicer look instead of the bubble Guess well see how it looks when officially presented though,1,Negative

686,1687,This Contact the seller first to see if the issue can be resolved and check with the carrier to see if the device is stolen If you get no resolution from the seller or the device is stolen file the complaint with Paypal The last device I sold had a reactivation lock which I turned off and made damned sure I turned it off before I let it ship The seller should have turned this off before selling this device,1,Negative

726,1727,Yea Samsung is dumping stock in other companies to raise cash for all the Note 7 mess Not surprising that they are slowing down at the moment,1,Negative
727,1728,Few websites do that for no reason but eh its whatever Samsung wants to add 4K for the Tab S3 and make sure the battery doesnt overheat so the delay is for additional testing,1,Negative

738,1739,I have mine the only time I was a little worried was when the system updated today and the phone ran a little hot Put it under a cold rinse and its running cool now Thats literally the only time its run hotter than warm for me Since I got my phone at launch its ran cool to warm every single time even when I was initially downloading and running dozens of apps for the first few days Unfortunately my local T Mobile stores cant get it restocked enough though as they only got 40 units yesterday and ran out almost immediately I might have to wait until Monday to get it replaced,1,Negative
739,1740,I got mine on Thursday and still have it I know I should return it just because I really dont want my house to burn down but I dont want another phone Ive been keeping a close eye on it while it charges and its been doing fine it gets a little warm but my last phone did also I think Im gon na wait until I can go into an ATampT store and pick a new one up hopefully theres no deadline or something like that,1,Negative

747,1748,Yup upon reading an article describing the issue that stated 0 1 I thought maybe I should because 0 1 of 2 5 million is still 2500 devices That number was inaccurate because the actual reported number of cases was 35 which is 0 0014 Basically a slim af chance that youll have an exploding battery but not impossible Im waiting until I can walk in and exchange,1,Negative
748,1749,Got mine the day they came out Also cracked the screen the day I got it But it works like a charm and Im keeping it until the replacements arrive Also its nice that Im getting my cracked phone replaced for free,3,Positive
749,1750,I got mine from ATampT com pre order and had it since launch No issues or unusual warmth when charging Still going to exchange but not until I can exchange for another note 7 Until then I will be a little cautious just to be safe Only charging the phone while Im around it to keep a eye on it and not charging it overnight while sleeping Probably not necessary but with the fast charging its not really much of a pain,1,Negative
750,1751,Im keeping mine until they send me a replacement Im just being cautious while charging now for example not leaving it on the charger while unattended and not charging next to my head while I sleep,1,Negative

794,1795,From where did you purchase the phone itself On the link it appears as though and I may be entirely wrong so forgive me Samsung is refunding the accessories When I return my Note 7 to Verizon I intend on bringing the receipts for accessories that I purchased at Best Buy to see if this is indeed the case It may not be but it makes sense for Samsung to bear the burden of refunding accessories Edit an earlier iteration of this link mentioned accessories It looks like they have since removed that section,1,Negative
795,1796,What a joke what an absolute joke What the fuck are they doing They already fixed them right This will destroy the Note series I have never seen a tech disaster like this before Handed in my Note 7 yesterday Good fuck it Not worth the hassle dealing with Samsung again,2,Neutral

799,1800,The note 3 uses Gorilla Glass 3 which was essentially tank like on my nexus 6,1,Negative
800,1801,For everyone shitting on Corning its not a weakness of Gorilla Glass 5 its a weakness of Samsung insisting that they curve the glass Bending the glass makes it SO much weaker its not designed to be curved like that and Corning are not to blame,1,Negative

804,1805,I dreamed I had a note 7 and cracked it,3,Positive
805,1806,I broke three Note 5s in 72 days earlier this year The first time it would have broke if it were made of diamond the second time was a toss up but the last time was a joke It fell half a foot Now I never had a case so I am not removing my responsibility but I drop my Galaxy S5 all the time sometimes majestically and it didnt break before or now I love the Note and really want to get the 7 but is this still an issue,1,Negative
806,1807,Gorilla glas isnt mroe solid IMHO dropped my note 4 from 1 5m on a tile floor which completly shattered the screen Unlucky,3,Positive

808,1809,They are regular film protectors i just said glass protectors as in front and rear glass Sorry for the confusionthose are the ones i picked up at the store when i picked up the phone,1,Negative
809,1810,They actually say 80 chance of survival from 1 6 m high which is head height,1,Negative
810,1811,They claim its actually just the metal from the pick rubbing off But yeah it seems its supposed to be more shatter resistant but more scratchable,1,Negative
811,1812,Oh man you do have me beat,3,Positive
812,1813,lols,2,Neutral
813,1814,I have a line on mine this is my first high end phone I dont know what to do the crack isnt noticeable unless put above white background and can barely be seen unless you look at it from an angle I can feel the crack tho its a thin line across the screen I dont know what to do Should I just buy a screen protector and put it on Because the crack is small and bare seeable,1,Negative
814,1815,If you cant do without or think you want all the new s pen features I say its worth it Otherwise if you dont need a stylus go without,2,Neutral
815,1816,Does anyone know if the note 7 will have the same cooling as the s7 and s7 edge Im thinking about getting it but I dont want to have overheating issues like the s6 since I do plan on getting the gear vr with it,1,Negative
816,1817,There is nothing the S7 Edge can do that the Note 7 couldnt The Note 7 is pretty much a slightly bigger slightly improved and slightly more refined S7 Edge with an S Pen The difference is really only about 100 and not 200 like you stated talking about new Its really a question of if you use S Pen or not There just isnt enough differentiating feature and I wouldnt even say the price is that big of a difference between the 2 phones,1,Negative
817,1818,At least in the US the official unlocked version is 779 and Note 7 is 850 which is what the US unlocked version of Note 7 will cost once it releases in couple of months What S7 edge costs 650 Are you talking about the international unlocked models without warranty Samsung pay dont work etc So its definitely worth 70 to 100 actual price difference,1,Negative
818,1819,If you would utilize full use out of the pen yes Plus it still has some features the S7 doesnt have I heard the sound quality is improved thats a mouth to ear thing though My justification of getting it is that I heavily used the pen It was great at writing quick notes easy place to have a quick screen grab and I just always used it for a multitude of things I didnt use it a lot early on but I spent time with it and made it a habit to use and I realized that the s pen is much more than a regular stylus It is a proper functionality feature that has a hell lot of potential for the Note,0,Verynegative
819,1820,Preordered yesterday Feel in hand is second to none for me Got my 6p on Swappa,1,Negative
820,1821,I wouldnt say so More rigid build due to higher quality aluminum Gorilla Glass 5 Improved screen 50 brighter at max HDR compatibility Vastly improved UX S Pen Iris scanner a gimmick for most people USB C USB 3 1 Slightly larger screen and dimensions 100mAh smaller battery Less curved display Significantly better in hand feel,1,Negative
821,1822,Is a s pen worth 200 to you,3,Positive
822,1823,It depends on your use case The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen has the iris scanner as a security option and of course the greatly improved S Pen and the more fine tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it get the Note If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge Theyre both great phones it just depends on what feel is the most important part some more features or saving money,1,Negative
823,1824,Whats the difference between GG4 and GG5,2,Neutral
824,1825,If you want the S Pen then there are enough other small improvements to make it worth the price However if you dont like the S Pen then I dont think those small improvements are enough to justify 100 200 by themselves,1,Negative
825,1826,Its not an easy decidion Nonetheless do you prefer bigger phones Would you use the stylus,2,Neutral
826,1827,Easily worth the extra 200 Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you can not get to the finger print scanner USB 3 1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features I would pay more for anyone of those but to add them all together is a bargain for 200,3,Positive

846,1847,You got the zagg tempered glass screen protector They dont even have it on their website And yes people still use screen protectors because my galaxy s7 glass isnt scratch proof no one has a screen that can prevent scratches,1,Negative

891,1892,Im sorry that you had this experience with T Mobile With rates that cheap they have to cut corners somewhere right It used to be that youd be stuck with a terrible network with them now that thats improved I guess its customer service and lack of uniformity in corporate store policies,1,Negative
892,1893,T Mobile locations are absolute shit The T Mobile phone supervisors are the absolute best If you ever have a huge problem like this speak directly to a supervisor and explain what theyre doing wrong Ive had a supervisor give us a 200 credit in the past You ended up getting free phones somehow because the supervisors are the only ones that get stuff done,1,Negative
893,1894,ATampT user here and I had the same experience Literally walked into my store returned the phone and that was it Maybe were lucky I dont know but that was a painless 5 minute return for me and it seems like on Reddit theres another person every day with issues of exchange or return on a worldwide recall Granted I didnt have to do an exchange as I have a backup phone but I cant imagine its significantly more difficult I guess the big issue here is if you can wait for the note 7 replacement or not I personally will be fine without the note 7 for a few more weeks as Im not going to die without it which seems to be the case for most people online,0,Verynegative

911,1912,Mine is fine but I dont drop my phones,3,Positive
912,1913,Not my screen but my back glass broke about 3 months after I got the phone I dropped it while I was sleeping The phone was next to me while charging and I guess my arm got caught on the cord and the phone was pretty much just thrown onto a concrete floor I am glad my screen is fine though,1,Negative
913,1914,I just broke my S7 Edge yesterday Had it for a month and a half I shattered the back glass when it didnt have a case on shattered the front with a case on Luckily its by the button and not in the middle of the screen Maybe sprint will let me upgrade to the Note 7 if I pay extra,1,Negative
914,1915,I feel like the only case that will protect the screen is a smart cover case,3,Positive
915,1916,Oh man I was hoping there was a thread regarding this I had a 5s before my note 7 and have been worryong about the screens integrity In the 2 years I had my 5s the entire phone held up like a champ I never once replaced the screen or phone My concern with the note 7 was the edge style screen Im curious about peoples experiences with Samsungs other edge style phones as well though as well as what case would potentially work best for the note 7,1,Negative
916,1917,Count me in for that sad club Bought it on Friday smashed the upper left corner on Saturday Case came yesterday It doesnt interfere with functionality and a little bit of its beauty is blemished but the water resistance is done So I will pay to get it fixed T Mobile washes its hands of the whole thing sent me to Samsung Edit Reason I dropped it Had it on my lap about 18 off the pavement and that damn glass back is sooo slippery,1,Negative

927,1928,i had a great experience with them also they had no s7 edges in stock for verizon so they mailed me a check for 792,1,Negative
928,1929,One thing Ive seen Asurion do is get a lot more streamlined I originally had a 2014 Moto X but the screen cracked They sent me an S5 as they had no Moto Xs in stock A couple months later Im at work using my phone and put it down to take a call on the landline While on the call the screen shut off like normal to save power After the call I picked my S5 back up but the screen wouldnt turn on I tried everything Battery restart etc and nothing was working but the phone would still vibrate that indicates it was accepting input Called up Asurion and told them their replacement device they sent me stopped working for absolutely no reason and they having no S5 or Moto Xs in stock sent me a nice new gold S6 A couple of years ago it felt like Id be on the phone with Asurion for 2 hours but recently it seems like a 20 minute call at most is all I need to make,1,Negative
929,1930,All I had to do to submit my claim is go to their website sppmobileclaims com and submit a claim using the phone number that I gave them when I bought protection plus They called me next day to confirm what I said on the claim The second claim went really wrong though because they sent me a letter saying they never received my old device so they were going to charge me 400 I called them at the official number they have on their website and the rep Just said I have to call USPS and give them the tracking number and say it was never delivered and USPS will give me a claim number and to just give that to an spp rep and I wouldnt have to pay anything They connect you to an actual person when you call the number really quickly and they are good at what they do Id rate them up there with Amazons customer service Im thinking you were calling the wrong number and were talking to insurance for T Mobile or any other cellular provider that also deals with them and not Samsung protection plus which use the same insurance company This is their correct number you call it or visit the website I mentioned earlier only those will put you in direct contact with their spp department and not their other departments,1,Negative

945,1946,I left Samsung after the S2 a few years ago for an LG up until now Will be returning to Samsung for the S7 I absolutely hated Touchwiz but these phones and the UI are fucking phenomenal As soon as I found out there would be manual video controls I was completely persuaded to come back instead of looking to the G5 Just my preference as a bit of a cameraphile I hope that the reviews hold up and that the phone has decent longevity Im really looking forward to this,1,Negative

962,1963,I upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the S7 Edge and love it I definitely couldnt wait for the S8 and was well due for an upgrade still arguably one of the best Android phones out there along with the 6P Note 7 and maybe the Moto Z,3,Positive
963,1964,What it comes down to is if you want the phone now or in six months time ish The S7 is a top phone,2,Neutral
964,1965,Waiting for S8,2,Neutral
965,1966,If thats the only two phones you are looking at then S7 for sure You wont see a massive difference in performance since there is no 10nm yet But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7 I suggest this because Google phones are updated and most secure android phones you will ever find,1,Negative
966,1967,I am in the same predicament I was gon na go with the note 7 I always wait for the storm to ride out as I call it the beta test and thankfully so Since its big recall I am too scared to mess with it anymore So Im waiting for the S8 edge its just about 5 6 months away look at it as 137 days away,1,Negative
967,1968,Not to be a dick but why would it increase the life of his phone,1,Negative
968,1969,Wait for the S8 It will be awesome and announced earlier,2,Neutral
969,1970,The s8 is reportedly going to be out Q1 or Q2 2017 depends if you can wait that long The s8 will be better than the s7 but the s7 is still a top notch phone,1,Negative
970,1971,I think really at this point the S7 has everything you need I personally went with the S7 Edge But wireless charging water resistant great camera great screen its really the whole package Only thing lacking if you could even call it lacking USB C,1,Negative
971,1972,If you can just wait it out The s8 will obviously be better and even if you dont like it you can get an s7 for cheaper by then,1,Negative
972,1973,I am with U S Cellular they are the only coverage in my rural area and they have a pretty limited phone selection They dont sell the Moto phones anymore which would be my second choice,1,Negative
973,1974,Im waiting to see what the S8 will be like,2,Neutral
974,1975,I think I will go with the S16 9,2,Neutral
975,1976,I switched from a 6s to an S7 love it High quality phone for sure The screen is glorious gorilla glass too,3,Positive
976,1977,I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7 having to return it under the recall I really never got used to the edge thing and battery life was not near even my 2 year old 6 but it was OK I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time Battery life is also kinda short depending on what the phone is doing but it feels like less than the 6 most of the time I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor Nirvana to me would be Android OS on an iPhone For now Im going back to iPhone not because Im in love with the OS or the customer hostile attitude but just because I feel like I can have the thing for years and know that it wont explode or shatter or mysteriously die without it at least being under a better warranty than mail it in and wait 2 weeks while we find a way to blame you Assuming youre not concerned about the build quality then the S7 is a fine phone Its bigger than the non plusses and large enough that I can still fat finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it If you can overlook the neon glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing Ive seen especially at night when the black screen background is black And being able to get content on and off of it without iTunes cancer is miraculous in and of itself Chrome on Android kills Safari even on IOS 10 IMO I dont think youd be missing anything going to the S7 if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem As long as it doesnt explode or shatter Also compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster most of the time there is no waiting for things to load but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device,1,Negative
977,1978,I am in the same bloody boat Currently using Note5 wanted to get a Note7 when it came out but then the phones were recalled and whole exploding battery fiasco thing kind of scared me Decided to go for an iPhone7 but seeing the reviews and even the speed tests I am not sure it is worth the money and I am back to block 1 Should I get the Note7 when it launches with safe batteries get an S7 Edge or wait for an S8 So fucking torn between these three choices,1,Negative
978,1979,If only it wasnt ATampT exclusive Id consider it if there was an unlocked International version,1,Negative
979,1980,I currently have the S7 Edge in Onyx Black So worth it,3,Positive
980,1981,Wait If for no other reason for price drops of the older models once the new model comes out,2,Neutral
981,1982,Oh man im also torn at the moment Im using an iPhone 6 right now and have been doing since it was released and im happy with the phone but im kind of tired with Apple locking everything down iPhone 7 is just Apple helping me with the decision to switch over Im sure i would be really happy with the S7 but im also afraid that ill regret not waiting for the S8 when its released,1,Negative
982,1983,Its risky because they can stop paying their phone plan and you end up with a blacklisted phone,2,Neutral
983,1984,I recently came from an iPhone 6 to an S7 Edge It is an amazing phone and Im not worried about newer phones like the S8 coming out This is because there isnt really anything that this phone is missing It has a bloody massive battery great screen micro SD card support IP68 water resistance etc The S8 will most likely have the new iris scanner but honestly a finger print scanner is more practical and probably faster What Im saying is that the S7 difference from an S8 wont be that big especially when you previously used an iPhone,1,Negative
984,1985,19th September or October I was told Id get mine carphone warehouse too 2nd October,1,Negative
985,1986,Same Not giving up my phone unless there is like a super ridiculous time frame like January 2017 Especially not going to iPhone again because I just got done transferring everything over it seems like Hopefully the early October like they said is the later date,0,Verynegative
986,1987,I prefer USB C Coming from iPhone I cant imagine having to actually look and see which way the cord goes in each time Sounds archaic Not to mention the 64gb internal which is important for us folks who keep all our porn in Secure Folder which doesnt allow storing on the SD card Also the screen is brighter AND dimmer,1,Negative
987,1988,I had something similar happen to me I had a Note 4 which was a great phone But the motherboard started to go out Its resetting itself and freezing and now is stuck in a constant reboot loop I argued with Sprint for 4 DAYS over them getting me out of my contract and selling me the phone with their new contract price because I didnt want to spend 850 on it I finally got them to agree to drop my contract and start a new one so I can get the phone I put in an order for 2 of them one for me and one for my wife Then I wake up the next day and the phone has been recalled Never even shipped it to me Now my Note 4 is 100 dead and Im using my wifes old S5,0,Verynegative
988,1989,Do you still have your note or have you traded it in,2,Neutral
989,1990,Samsung pinpointed the issue and resolved it a good while ago now And replacement units were shipped out to stores However folks demanded the government step in with an official recall Rather than waiting even longer for that Samsung consulted with the Consumer Product Safety Commission Now youre all waiting for word from the CPSC before the phones can actually be released The original timetable had exchange units in stores by today or Friday Now its out of Samsungs hands,1,Negative
990,1991,I stopped by best buy today just for curiosity and was told the replacement shipments were shipped out Monday Whether or not that was factual I have no way of verifying but I also did not purchase my phone there employee account so he really had no incentive to lie to me,1,Negative
991,1992,Trust me even we dont actually know,2,Neutral
992,1993,Thanks for the recommendation Ill download it today and try it out,3,Positive
993,1994,Upvote for the humor I had a good laugh I went from Samsung keyboard to Swiftkey now I use Google keyboard You can type a word then select it in the recommendation bar up top to add it to memory Alas I can cuss all day long without spell check,1,Negative
994,1995,When comparing with the iPhone 5 keyboard and autocorrect which I owned and used for around a year before I purchased a Samsung S6 Edge have now had for a year also I found the autocorrect for the iPhone was far nicer At first I put it down to just getting used to the new phones nuances but since then Ive realised I did just find typing a text less cumbersome on the iPhone I frequently have to delete the autocorrection because the phone didnt recognise the word refill out the edited part then hit space only to have it autocorrect again I dont know exactly why but this I think has been one of the bigger issues Ive had with switching that just hasnt settled in every other difference is now just normal and I struggle to remember how to navigate an iPhone,1,Negative
995,1996,Not sure why youd want to drop so far down in performance but to each their own I suppose,1,Negative
996,1997,My Note 4 was great and aged amazing The only drawback was battery it would reach a certain point and then jump to very low numbers Like it would go to 20 or 24 and drop to either 0 or 8 Could be the battery or I could have damaged something with leaving it someplace hot because that seems to be the case with battery issues Ive seen,2,Neutral
997,1998,This I had iPhone4 then sgs3 now sgs5 and thinking of what to switch to next I miss the smoothness of iPhone but keep remembering that end of 2 years of iPhone4 when I was so tired of the phone With my sgs5 I can throw on a new launcher or get rid of all my old widgets and install new ones to tide me over till more options come out,1,Negative
998,1999,I see the whole IOS is optimized for the hardware argument being thrown around a lot I left IOS because the updates slowed my iPhone down to the point where it was almost unusable Got ta love that optimization Ive been using a Note 5 since the end of last year The phone has gotten faster with updates particularly MM The software experience is actually really good and its highly customisable The hardware is the selling point for these phones You get the best phone screen on the market Period Awesome battery life An amazing camera Wireless charging Premium build quality Expandable storage Waterproofing Samsung pay works in more places Anything prior to the Note 4 is going to give a less than stellar representation of the Samsung experience as prior to that It honestly was a bad experience Samsung have taken their game to the next level with their recent phones especially the S7 series,1,Negative

1,2001,I am amazed about how the headphone jack wont make you buy the iphone 7 You still didnt see what apple has to say about this it might be because the phone became waterproof so the headphone jack could be replaced with different earphones Dont be so negative before the iphone 7s release,1,Negative
2,2002,Having owned Samsungs since the first galaxy I can tell you that Ive only had issues with one and that was the s3 and that was my fault I dropped it 3 times not in a row down iron bark stairs After a while it just stopped working This was around the time the s5 came out and I bought an s5 not long after Ive now moved onto the s7 edge but my s5 is onto a new owner and still working fine Owning a samsung is like owning a desktop You have to care for it delete old shit watch out for nasty surprises and keep the skin flicks to a minimum,1,Negative

5,2005,Im moving on from my 6s plus to a note 7 That screen and camera and no bezels got me Ill navigate android just fine I think Plus I need to break free of the apple ecosystem now or I never will IMO the note 7 is everything the iPhone plus should be but instead we just got an iPhone with a bigger screen thats all Ive been using iOS 10 since the first public beta and right now on the 6th its pretty much solid and smooth and it does nothing of any significance for me,1,Negative

10,2010,Youll only be missing out on an Iris Scanner and 64GB Base Storage If you dont need the S Pen I think the edge has got you covered,1,Negative
11,2011,I really hope this is not true because being stuck on the May patch while the carrier versions are on July if Im not mistaken is kind of discouraging I will probably sell this if this is the case and go iPhone Nexus or Note 7 Part of the reason why I bought this was because I assumed itd get updates without carrier interference but I could be mistaken Time will tell but as of right now Im still happy with it,2,Neutral
12,2012,Yes their support team needs retraining They dont even know their products Terrible,1,Negative
13,2013,Im very sorry for any confusion Our unlocked devices do not receive updates This is because carriers Becca is in need of some retraining because clearly Samsungs other unlocked international non branded devices can and do receive updates both full releases and security updates so yeah just ignore Becca,1,Negative
14,2014,I took it to the Samsung repair centre and they would have fixed it if my warranty was still valid but there was a little crack in the back so they quoted me 150 for it I ended up getting a wireless charger and that does work so if you can try a wireless charger to check it that might work for you I went into a phone store that had some lying out,0,Verynegative
15,2015,I tried a few older cables and USBs but none were working I just had it in a Samsung Repair centre and none of theirs did either Ive ended up just ordering a wireless charger for now Samsung wanted almost 150 to fix it,1,Negative

71,2071,If you can get a good deal on the S7 500 range then go for it Otherwise I would take the next few months to save up for the S8 which is probably going to be 800 dollars I have the S6 Edge and was going to upgrade to the S7 but its better to just save the few hundred dollars for the upcoming S8,1,Negative

90,2090,Woke up and took it off the charger Are you charging over night with the fast charger That could be a large part of your problem right there A lot of android phones dont automatically stop charging at 100 especially if they are fast charging You may have overcharged your battery,1,Negative
91,2091,Ive also just started experience an extreme battery drain on my Galaxy S6 Edge today Really not sure what the issue is Battery seems to be reporting a heavy use of Google Services but Im curious if it has anything to do with the recent update that came out a few days ago Im on Verizon Its reached 20 twice today so far and Im barely using it It usually lasts through the workday at about 60 but its nowhere near that today Its also noticeably more hot to the touch today Battery seems to be in overdrive for whatever reason Restarting the phone didnt help either,1,Negative

95,2095,It could be this it was happening to me this morning Uninstalling the Oculus app fixed it immediately,1,Negative
96,2096,You could try thisIf youre experiencing overheating even when not using or charging your phone it could be down to a particular app Luckily the Battery optimiser setting allows you to stop apps from sapping energy when the phone isnt in use Go to Settings Battery Battery Usage More Optimise battery usage and tap All Apps Doing this will stop apps from working in the background even when youre not using the phone If overheating persists you can try wiping the cache partition With your Galaxy S7 turned off press and hold the Power Home and Volume Up buttons together until you see the Samsung logo and then release This launches the S7 s Android system recovery mode Tap the Volume Down button to scroll down the list of options and then select Cache Partition by pressing the Power button If all else fails a factory reset might be in order If that proves unsuccessful its time to return the S7 to Samsung for a replacement,1,Negative
97,2097,In another thread someone said that having the Gear VR app installed was causing this,1,Negative
98,2098,My Galaxy S7 Edge did indeed overheat using the charger that came with the unit the adaptive fast charger My wifes unit also gets hot to the touch while charging As a result of my unit overheating it discolored and pitted the area around the Home Button very close to the charger connection I was given a reference number then received an email that my complaint was without merit I offered to send a pic while on chat and she said okay but never asked further Nowwith the bs update I have a two 600 useless paperweights I am pissed,1,Negative
99,2099,It looks like the phone was put on a hotplate The battery hasnt vented so thats not what caused it And it only seems to be melted around the edges those in which would be the first to touch a hot plate or frying pan on an oven I say this because the CPU which is what generates the most heat in the device is located in the center by the camera not the outer edges of the phone I think someone just tried to pull a fast one to get their phone replaced on you,1,Negative

140,2140,Unfortunately I dont think that Capital One has any plans to support Samsung Pay,1,Negative
141,2141,Those are mostly smaller community banks and credit unions It just goes to show that if smaller banks and credit unions can offer Samsung Pay support for their customers that larger banks and issuers have no excuse for not offering it too,1,Negative

144,2144,Discover has said they wont be ready to support SP until early 2016 Wells Fargo has no excuse since they are already supporting Apple and Android Pay Supporting Samsung Pay would be extremely simple for banks already supporting Apple Pay and Android Pay They probably want Samsung to pay them to support SP,1,Negative
145,2145,Well I mean its usually quicker for me to either pay in cash or hand them a card So I rationalized the added step of dealing with loading the app was that if I used it 5 times Id get a good reward Now you have to use it like a lot to get any reward I mean I could have seen them scale it back a little be like OK you need to use it 10 times then maybe 20 etc etc But they went from like 5 times for like 6 months or so to like 50,1,Negative

155,2155,I keep hearing all these claims of from what Ive seen and mine has scratches and all I did is put it in my pocket and I believed the hype and have gotten more paranoid But Ive seen little picture evidence to support the claims Outside of display models the JRE video and a couple random pics on the net where are all the pics Ive also heard multiple reports of no scratches from everyday commuters to construction workers but like all things the negatives seem to get the most attention Ive had mine since day one with a case covering the back and naked on the front Ive been careful probably over protective and I have no scratches Yet Fingers crossed but Im beginning to think the sky isnt falling,1,Negative
156,2156,The back of the phone isnt as strong as the front of the phone I use to have an iphone that was all glass and it scratched like crazy The important thing is I learned to go commando and not care about cases anymore Sure my GS5 looks like its been through war but Ive enjoyed its beauty everyday for the past 2 years without it being wrapped around a giant condom,1,Negative

163,2163,My idea is to try a no lock screen app It should attempt to open the phone when the screen is turned on which should be halted by the Iris scanner then just look at it,1,Negative
164,2164,This is the best tldr I could make original reduced by 67 Im a bot This characteristic was also bestowed upon the Galaxy S7 Active released by ATampT a couple of months ago in June but following a water resistance test conducted by Consumer Reports it was determined that the Galaxy S7 Active variant was not as efficient in keeping water away from its internals as its standard counterpart Samsung replied by stating that they ampquotStand behindampquot the Galaxy S7 Active IP68 certificate but more recently the company backtracked and confirmed that some Samsung Galaxy S7 Active units are faulty and their water resistance is compromised In other words Samsung wonamp039t offer lifetime warranty for the faulty units and although new stock seems to have been shipped to ATampT prospective Samsung Galaxy S7 Active buyers donamp039t seem to have a way of determining whether the unit they are about to buy is part of the old or the new stock Extended Summary FAQ Version 1 6 88394 tldrs so far Theory Feedback PMs and comment replies are read by the bot admin constructive feedback is welcome Top keywords Samsung 1 Galaxy 2 water 3 Active 4 unit 5,1,Negative

239,2239,Interesting Typically the warranty does not apply to anyone except the original owner not you in this situation bc you bought it on swappa However this is not a warranty issue Supposedly even devices damaged from drops etc will be replaced within reason Dont know why they wouldnt replace one that was bought through a 3rd party If worst comes to worst go to www bestbuy comnote7info and sign up for updates And go to the carrier store and tell them you bought it out of town or something to that effect On another note who TF buyssells a 2 week old phone on swappa edit words,1,Negative

249,2249,Well of youre willing to trust the device with information like bank accounts and card information you better hope they have everything secure with no possible intrusions So maybe waiting is better then having a feature that comes with a great risk,3,Positive
250,2250,Return it as Not fit for purpose if the watch was advertised as havingor going to have soon a feature and doesnt then the watch as it stands isnt fit for purpose,1,Negative
251,2251,I know youre joking but still hate you for getting my hopes up,1,Negative
252,2252,I mentiond this in another thread about the same issue Samsung pay was one of the things they advertised with the Gear S2 They also advertised MapMyRun intergration as a premier partner So I bought the watch Then I learned that they lied about Samsung Pay as it wasnt actually available for the watch Then I learned that MapMyRun actually wasnt available either with no plans of ever actually making it available in the future The Nike intergration is absolute shit and has tons of problems so its nearly useless And there are no other alternatives since the app store is a total and complete joke Basically you can get watch faces on the store Thats it Most everything else is junk I think I bought my last Samsung watch Tizen isnt going to be taking off anytime soon but they refuse to let it go,1,Negative

258,2258,AMEX is allowed Along with Citi Chase and Wells Fargo,1,Negative
259,2259,This is as good as any of the deals Ive seen them run this year I dont see any reason to wait and hope for a better one because youll be waiting at least two months as thats how long this promotion is going Its a really convenient way to pay,2,Neutral
260,2260,Youve bruised your phone,2,Neutral
261,2261,Your LCD is broken so the only solution is to replace it This happened to my wifes S4 so I paid a repair place 80 to install new screen and LCD and it was good as new,1,Negative
262,2262,Mine did that It eventually turned green after resetting it The phone is piss weak,1,Negative
263,2263,It will still plug into a pc fine backup all your info pics contacts etc A replacement screen for s4 when I looked was about 120 quid and isnt too bad a job as the lcd unit in its entirety needs replacing replacing just the glass is waaaaay more complicated Getting someone to replace my screen for me e g Carphone Warehouse was more like 160 quid and they will completely reset to manufacturer settings Good luck,1,Negative

268,2268,That looks a hell of a lot like Type C to me I think its just the angle but only time will tell,1,Negative
269,2269,From that angle it looks a lot like a Type C After I got my Nexus 6P I actually dont mind the Type C The faster charging is my primary advantage As long as Samsung does what Google does and includes a charging cable but a Type A to Type C cable I have no complaints,1,Negative
270,2270,She is obviously an Apple fanboy In this article she compares the S6 and iPhone 6S and says that the iPhone wins in the features department simply because of 3D touch She does mention that the S6 has a heartrate monitor infrared transmitter and wireless charging but those are just mentioned as an afterthought as if they have no value whatsoever,1,Negative
271,2271,It looks like its written by an apple fanboy,2,Neutral
272,2272,He is no doubt paid by Apple This is a worthless article You could make the same argument picking an android phone with a better battery than the ip6 and say well you better switch platforms,1,Negative
273,2273,11 hours of web browsing12 hours of video playbackI fucking wish lol,1,Negative
274,2274,This article literally says nothing relevant whatsoever Considering the only real thing its comparing is battery life the iPhone 6 is still sad in every other category,1,Negative
275,2275,feels like it the way the writer uses the word anyhow just makes it seem more opinionated rather than informative especially as it does state it is better than other android competitors,1,Negative

280,2280,Somebody has to take the blame SDI is still apart of Samsungs brand though,2,Neutral
281,2281,Accurate title I guess but this was my thought Samsung is finger pointing and may be at the end of a lawsuit because of it Samsung was quick to blame the battery for causing some Note 7 devices to catch fire but it has since widened its investigation after replacement phones using batteries from Chinas Amperex Technology also caught fire,1,Negative

284,2284,I love the themes but I havent paid for any yet My favorite free themes are called Alien Theme Vintage Mountains Whale Live Pug Retro and Impressionism If I were going to pay for themes I would have a hard time choosing between Poppy Retro Cafe Theme and V window theyre super lovely Theres also one called MaterialisticUI that looks like what Daredevils Matt Murdock would look like if he were trapped inside a phone theme,1,Negative

291,2291,Galaxy S7E has the same issue,2,Neutral
292,2292,Strange my S7 edge is pretty snappy when it comes to multitasking,2,Neutral
293,2293,The practical application is when you go to show someone a photo and it takes 27 seconds to wake up the device and open Gallery Then when you go to scroll through all your photos there is a delay While I dont think this is going to be the same level problem as I had with my S6 Active on Lollipop I still think it is important to let the manufacturer know that it is something that should be addressed as if they dont already know,1,Negative
294,2294,While it would be nice for it to have the memory to go back to where it left off this doesnt put me off of getting Note I have tried a Note and iPhone and given both a try Note 7 please I just cant do iPhone I dont like the ios or anything really Not my cup of tea Plus the Note 7 has much more use behind it than the hardware I have found In my book the Note still leads for me because I have other needs for it that iPhone does not have,2,Neutral
295,2295,Note 5 user here if you watch through to the second round the user opens the apps a second time and on the Note 7 they have to reload completely into memory,1,Negative
296,2296,So your saying a program that is written to benchmark Apple products doesnt properly benchmark a Samsung product Go ahead and try to argue the whole IOS and Android app thing and youll be wrong because Apple holds everything from its hardware to the software that it runs on Samsung makes the hardware and then adds its own flavor to the software that Google maintains Completely different it isnt an Apples to Apples comparison Try comparing it to another Android phone instead youd be allot closer Dang 8 years and we are still having this argument,0,Verynegative
297,2297,Honestly these tests are useless for me becaues I dont care about a few seconds,1,Negative
298,2298,Wonder whats the next excuse after iphone wins the same test with Note 7 running 1080p or 720p,1,Negative
299,2299,Cant be worse than the note 5 if not Ill take the storage expansion and bad ram management over my note 5 all day My phone isnt my overclocking gaming rig and benchmarking my phone is not important to me I dont need it to render video or run over clocked for 8 hours on aida64 or prime 95 with ihigh temperatures Some people really buy phones for reasons other than calling and media Like more important reasons like benchmarking Need to make a sub for that Or is that the Sony Xperia forum or some other foreign brand that doesnt usually work for american carriers,0,Verynegative
300,2300,Ah yes for all the times I want to open and then immediately close all of the apps on my homescreen,1,Negative

304,2304,This is probably the best description of phone speed Ive read As you can see the difference between these rival flagships is really negligible While the iPhone 6 proved to be ever so slightly quicker at loading some apps the S6 Edge was quicker at loading others But in each case there was only milliseconds between the two,1,Negative

341,2341,Was the phone charged under your pillow or something Ive noticed if I charge electronics on my bed or under pillowblanket they can get warmer than usual The thing Ive noticed with those chargers even OEM ones is that the USB cable goes bad after 1 year or so You can tell by slower charges The adapter is usually fine but Ive had to replace a few USB cables,2,Neutral

365,2365,Yeah going from a 6s to an s7 edge then to note 7 it wasnt amazingly different I think the only reason I would tell you to get the s7 edge is if you were inexperienced with android but you had it before so no point Plus I am sure it will have Android N on it which will make it better,1,Negative
366,2366,Aside from iris scanner 4k resolution and dual camera setup itll practically be the same as S7 with a slightly better 830 chipset its worth waiting if you arent in a rush for a phone but then again it might explode again,1,Negative

368,2368,This I was waiting for a phone that had been out for a month now i have to settle with a 6month old phone,1,Negative
369,2369,Thats what im thinking maybe its just high hopes but I expect it to be a loaded as possible phone and plenty of deals or incentives And for OPs other question Im sure Samsung would like to put it out earlier but that really depends on the suppliers and they definitely need to take their time and get this one right a rush job could easily end up in another disaster I would still expect it around Spring If your still fine with your phone I would definitely wait for the next round of true phone upgrades coming next year,1,Negative
370,2370,Im intrigued to see what they do with it but honestly I cant My last phone was broken so badly that when I send my note 7 back in I have nothing else to use,2,Neutral

388,2388,I purchased a Galaxy s5 when it first came out loved the phone the big screenand at that time I believe iPhone only had the regular small screen phones I switched over to the iPhone 6 Plus when I found out about the bigger screen Ive had it for 2 years now and I cant really complain about the phone Yeah you cant do much customization with it like you can with android but nowadays I really cant put in the time to customize it the way i want it When Samsung announced the Note 7 I did my research and was really impressed by it so I decided to switch back over to Android I preordered the phone and enjoyed the phone When I heard of the recall though I decided to return the Note 7 and get a refund I was a little put off by the recall I had concerns about the battery My phone would heat up after only using it for a few minutes Now I think I will wait and see what Apple comes out with tomorrow and decide between Samsung or Apple Im leaning more towards Apple though to be honest,1,Negative
389,2389,No but read the other comments here they are more reasonable because it doesnt assume the majority are tech enthusiasts like your post does All the things you listed are tech enthusiasts interests which wouldnt even show up in a infographic Any enthusiasts also knows iPhone 7s is the AMOLED Samsung is making them we are on a Samsung Subreddit btw display and would eye that instead of the mediocre upgrade coming tomorrow,1,Negative
390,2390,Before the recall there were people with iPhones that might have switched to the Note 7 if the iPhone 7 underwhelmed or got rid of the audio jack Now not so much,1,Negative
391,2391,People might switch because this makes Samsung look like it cant control the quality of their phones which is one thing that the public tends to believe Apple is very good at whether or not its true And for most people its either Samsung or Apple,1,Negative
392,2392,I think the reports of Apple buying more supplies after the note 7 bomb feature deployed is bogus I think supply chain gets ironed out well before the week of unveiling I think people who want note 7s will stay in the ecosystem of Samsung for their solution,1,Negative
393,2393,They cant replace it yet because there is no new version yet they either get an s7 as a replacement or wait for the new updated note 7,1,Negative
394,2394,It already has Id rather have all my fingers and no AUX port,1,Negative

433,2433,Contact Samsung support on twitter by direct message a rep is currently helping me there My original issue was that the FedEx tracking said label created and the scheduled arrival date was yesterday However upon contacting FedEx and Samsung they say that the physical package wasnt picked up by FedEx yet So now theyre contacting FedEx again,1,Negative

439,2439,I got my Gear Fit 2 This is my 2nd day with it and I absolutely love it I know the 256GB Micro SD card would have probably been the better choice but I have never had a smart watch before and now I am very happy with my choice,4,Verypositive
440,2440,Im sure you googled it by now but if not,1,Negative
441,2441,Thats an invitation to the press conference usually the launch date is weeks later,2,Neutral
442,2442,Not likely This is the first piece of news about the s3 other than the IFA teaser Good thing I held off on getting the s2 with my note 7,1,Negative
443,2443,I think they wold need x86 from Intel and x64 from AMD AMD and Intel have a mutual agreement currently,2,Neutral
444,2444,Short answer no not anytime soon Someone will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that intel owns the x86 platform and allows AMD to make chip sets using that architecture they get something out of it cant remember what though So a few years ago there was rumors that Samsung was going to buy AMD and Intel gently reminded AMD that if they got bought they would no longer be able to use it or something along those lines and the deal fell apart So Samsung chugs along making their Exynos chip for the mobile market because android plays nicely I guess I heard that the chromebook they made with the Exynos processor was a pain because the chromium OS is x86 based,1,Negative
445,2445,Would need the x64 license from amd Intel doesnt own that patent However I agree I dont see samsung entering the pc market due to the advanced r and d for it as well as heavy market saturation,2,Neutral
446,2446,it wouldnt be for awhile but a lot of things could happen over time to change this Microsoft is developing Windows as a universal platform which no longer relies on X86 to compete with the ever growing popularity of Android and Ios and none of them need x86 It really just depends what defines a PC for you Both google and apple are working on multitasking to take their mobile OS to the next level to work as desktops with easy multitasking As for gaming you wouldnt get the massive backlog of Direct X games until someone figures out how to portemulate but if devs choose to use vulkan games could run on them,1,Negative
447,2447,Samsung is really focused on the mobile and embedded markets Thats where ARM architecture shines The simpler architecture cheaper license and lower powerheat management requirements just cant be beat They have experimented with Intel in a tablet the Tab 3 10 1 and it was underwhelming They do make laptops and desktop PCs in some markets but in the US its a very small part of their business ARM is used in their TVs Phones Watches and a variety of home appliances,1,Negative
448,2448,Samsung is great my wife tried Apple twice and is officially done with them Once we get our school checks we are hopping back to Samsung I will admit Samsung has dropped the ball a bit with doing things The S7 is a bounce back to the top for them Note 7 I am iffy with I am part of the phablet community of die hards Im just iffy with the battery The size needs to be complimented with the battery because there will be more demand on it Luckily I am getting it in September so I will have some time to hear from consumers and see how the phone plays out I am excited for the new features I just wish they added onto the old ones I dont mind a 12mp camera but please up the processor and RAM because those are advancing big now and they should have jumped on that when phones are going beyond that soon or already I hope they come out with a versionlike how Apple does the advanced versions of their iPhones and they do that stuff Phone isnt even out yet so no one really has an accurate idea on how its performing in the market,1,Negative
449,2449,You dont need to go Samsung ecosystem Just Android I owned iPhone since the 3GS this is my first SamsungAndroid phone and I went all in I have a Nvidia shield Huawei watch and a Samsung tablet I also have 2 gear s2s Samsung makes the best Android phone imo and the Galaxy is always going to be comparable to the iPhone Your really investing in the Android eco system and its great I still use a Windows computer and laptop though But it works fine with Android and now windows 10 will allow actionable notifications with Android phones Samsung does have a first party solution in side sync also which I use currently I like the gear s2 but my android wear is better imo,1,Negative
450,2450,I switched from iphone 6 to the s7 edge last week and Im loving it so far As mentioned already its more of switching to the android ecosystem rather than Samsung The good thing about android is that its flexible so if you wanted to continue to use icloud you can download a 3rd party app that lets you sync to it I genuinely dont miss a thing from apple anything and everything I could do on the iPhone I can do with the s7 edge And touchwiz really isnt a problem anymore,1,Negative
451,2451,Made my switch in April I dont have as much as you but I do have a macbook pro iPad you can still use probably Apple watch see ya Apple Tv not sure and macbook is fine just no iMessage Right now my only samsung product is the s7 edge soon to be Note 7 I am perfectly ok with that Maybe for Christmas I will get the Gear VR but other than that dont plan on getting a tablet or watch I love android since I switched I almost wish it did it earlier but glad I waited for the great phones Takes maybe a week or so to get use to it fully but I was surprised how similar android is to iOS Differences for sure but most things came natural to me pretty fast,1,Negative
452,2452,I actually just pre ordered the note 7 and am abandoning my iPhone 6 plus I feel like its worth it and am very excited Remember that samsung has that easy sync tool that you can use smart switch and I intend to use it thoroughly myself Good luck,3,Positive
453,2453,Thanks,2,Neutral
454,2454,I agree the whole Edge design is terrible It feels wierd and the glare sucks Its not novel its an inconvenience,1,Negative
455,2455,Such a great help My man,3,Positive
456,2456,Thanks man Appreciate it do you think I should wait for it or get the s7 edge tmorrow Is it worth the wait,1,Negative
457,2457,Holy that was helpful Nice insider You should consider posting it as a post,1,Negative
458,2458,Agree So many rumors and leaks If I owned a tech website Id leak some info too and draft up some concept or fake photos to get my website traffic up bring home a bigger paycheck Phones and other tech are no different than celebrity news all those tabloids make money so why wouldnt technology follow suit to get views,1,Negative
459,2459,Theyll stand behind it until someone wants to get their water damaged phone covered under warranty,2,Neutral
460,2460,Or their water damaged gear s2 replaced Im done tih samsung watches after the debacle,2,Neutral
461,2461,What the fuck is the big deal about that The curve will be even less than the s7 edge,1,Negative
462,2462,Personally I think it looks pretty damn nice Then again Im a huge fan of the way the S7 Edge looks,1,Negative
463,2463,This but with the lack of anything really new being rumored for the note7 I bet it will be disappointing,1,Negative
464,2464,Do you know the reason why Samsung doesnt just use the Exynos everywhere Is it a supply chain or a carrier thing maybe,1,Negative
465,2465,The screenshots are not faked and the results match because they picked them from the same page of the results list There are hundreds of i6700K tests with different results listed however And they are speculating that this is a new SD 830 or Samsung Exynos prototype not actually a current S7 Links Qualcomm SAMSUNGIntel Core i7 6700K,1,Negative
466,2466,I find it highly unlikely for it to actually happen Were moving kinda slowly and to be honest this is not possible We had rumors of the 8890 from Samsung managing to hit 3 4K on single core Yet here we are and it isnt hitting that so I highly doubt the next mobile chip is going to be this performing,0,Verynegative
467,2467,How did you disable it I dont have that option All I can do is force stop it but that wont prevent it from starting back up,2,Neutral
468,2468,The phone says fast wireless charging just like it says fast charging when its plugged in,1,Negative
469,2469,how did you get the samsung wireless charger for free,2,Neutral

479,2479,This exact same thing happened to me and am on the phone with them as I type this I have called about 5 times since the approval email to confirm I would be getting the Gear S2 and about the estimated ship date 418 However I received the VR and now that Im on the phone with a rep they said they cant speak to me because its under my wifes email All the other times I called it wasnt a issue but now that there is a mistake they cant speak to me without her saying its okay,1,Negative
480,2480,I agree this link is more up to date and informative than reddit,3,Positive
481,2481,Removed,2,Neutral
482,2482,My thoughts exactly My initial excitement tapered off when I saw the price,1,Negative
483,2483,I doubt it This is meant to be paired with Gear VR not just a phone Gear VR is only 99 This will cost a bit more than that at least 3x so theyre not gon na give it away for free via promo,1,Negative
484,2484,I use the Material Blue and Black theme,2,Neutral
485,2485,Same thing happens to me only with HBO At this point I just memorized what is where I have a material theme installed which makes the task bar darker but HBO is still white on white I guess Ill just have to wait for an update If you find a solution let me know,1,Negative
486,2486,Go install a Samsung Theme from the Theme store They have some really nice ones that will change the colors of the UI Or you could try Good Lock from the Galaxy App Store to also alter the look of notifications,1,Negative
487,2487,Yup only way It only asks once after a restart in general,1,Negative
488,2488,Is this the same promo that came out with the S6 I used an emulator last year to do the S6 promo and am not getting any new unlocks with my S7 Edge,2,Neutral
489,2489,In short its a turn based card game made by Blizzard,2,Neutral
490,2490,My TV is only 2 years old,2,Neutral
491,2491,Maybe it is just that Samsung doesnt care about the user experience or app ecosystem that much because they plan for users defaulting to AppleTV or similar products Meanwhile Samsung does care about revenue from selling your viewing patterns to advertisers which they can do whether or not you use the Smart TV If this is the way it is maybe the Smart TV OSSoftware is just really designed to make it hard for people who are not too concerned or too persistent about their privacy to find the well hidden opt out options You can hardly blame people for not taking the time to hunt down the opt out options with so many things going on with their TV DVD Players etc,1,Negative
492,2492,This is a lesson I learned the hard way I spent so much more for a Smart TV only to end up buying a Chromecast,1,Negative
493,2493,Yea that makes sense I have a Samsung smart TV but since I got a roku I never use the apps Roku is just easier for me to use,1,Negative
494,2494,Yet definitely not OTA,2,Neutral
495,2495,Is super quick a couple hours or like one hour from 0 100,2,Neutral
496,2496,This is the standard one that took almost 3 hours to charge the S6 Edge With the S7 Edge having even larger battery I would wait for a sale on the fast version of the wireless charger Shaved off about a hour of charge time on the faster one Should be a good bit faster for the newer devices too,1,Negative
497,2497,Thats the one I linked in my main post haha I agree it looks nice though,1,Negative
498,2498,It is because of Pandora,2,Neutral
499,2499,Add a nomedia file to the folder,2,Neutral
500,2500,Just showed up on my S6,1,Negative
501,2501,Can you just hide or exclude the folder that the image is located in Not sure if the new stock gallery has that option Quickpic and other gallery apps do,1,Negative
502,2502,That actually makes sense I thought I was going crazy because no matter how many times I deleted it every time I opened my gallery it was back,1,Negative
503,2503,Yeah I think thats what it is Lol I feel so dumb I never noticed until right now that its the same logo as Pandora Unfortunately I looked on the app and still dont know how to get rid of it,1,Negative

507,2507,Stupid reasoning IMO Its a niche market and they will pay for it,1,Negative
508,2508,Im guessing no verizon yet,2,Neutral
509,2509,Mine has always stayed plugged in and its been like so for the past two months that I got it No issues whatsoever As far as putting it away from things I havent ran into issues to give me a reason to isolate it I just have it on my office desk next to my gear s2 wireless charger No issues of overheating or anything,1,Negative
510,2510,I used to leave it plugged in until it started creating this really high pitched noise So I plug it in to charge while sleeping and remove it when I wake up,1,Negative
511,2511,Its kind of a joke among people who know me to say that I will tell them to RTFM when they ask for help,2,Neutral
512,2512,If you want to use your phone like an iPhone the home menu being like an iPhone My S7E has this option to do it on So go to Settingsadvanced featuresgalaxy Labs and then show all apps on screen This will make your touch wiz homepage like an iOS homepage You dont need a launcher I dont know why people say touch wiz is really bad its fairly fast good to use If you dont like the colors you can apply themes from the theme store The one Im using right now is the Material Dark for the S7E although it might not be available for you but do look at other themes makes the phone even more beautiful,1,Negative
513,2513,Gon na try that Im gon na sound like such a noob but what exactly do the launchers do,1,Negative
514,2514,touchwiz is as good as ios What parallel universe do you live in,3,Positive
515,2515,Cool Ill try that Im just confused about all the different settings and features basically Just so accustomed to myou easy to use and navigate iPhones Im definitely already happy with my choice though just all the options are a bit overwhelming at first,1,Negative
516,2516,Go into the settings applications and disable anything that looks like its from your carrier Except Verizon sms if you dont want to and virtual voicemail or whatever ATampT and a few others have a lot of crap bloatware that will slow down your phone,1,Negative
517,2517,Good Lock from Galaxy App Store Nova Launcher Prime Two great places to start Check the options for both and customize ever hunting to just how you like it Can do icon packs etc with nova All kinds of gestures like swiping on an icon to open a folder etc,1,Negative

519,2519,I would watch a youtube video on top tips for the S7 This is the quickest way to find out what the phone is capable of,1,Negative
520,2520,I would definitely watch a few how to and secrets videos about the gs7 edge Theyll help you get a general understanding of your phone Just remember with a galaxy if theres something you dont like about your phone theres probably a setting you can use to change it,2,Neutral
521,2521,I pre ordered mine last night from Samsung UKs website and it was delivered today during lunch,1,Negative
522,2522,Yeah it looks like Frontier comes with and without LTE They could have made this clearer,1,Negative
523,2523,People keep worrying about or hating on the size And it seems they always have because they used to hate on the original samsung watch which was smaller than this one I have always worn a casio gshock watch and have never had an issue with the size of any of these I wouldnt worry about it Big watches are in now anyways,1,Negative
524,2524,I like the fact that it looks like a normal watch,2,Neutral

536,2536,Another example of Crappy Samsung customer service Samsung is giving me more reasons every day to stop buying their product,1,Negative
537,2537,Canada BC Tom Harris Telus Wasnt given the service center never really crossed my mind to ask,2,Neutral
538,2538,Once I got it back I kinda realised that future of the phone wouldnt be a thing anymore Thanks for reminding me though,2,Neutral
539,2539,My thoughts exactly,2,Neutral
540,2540,Yeah I just dont really understand what they could have broken because I fixed it myself after Im actually typing on it right now Just threw a case on it to hide the back,1,Negative
541,2541,Not sure about that but I bought a case from Amazon and I asked and they gave me a full refund for the case and did not ask for it to be returned,1,Negative
542,2542,Depending on wherewho you purchased your device from you should definitely be reimbursed Source I work at a verizon retailer and we refund all note 7 accessories bought here,1,Negative
543,2543,When I read it it made it sound like you could only return stuff that you bought from that particular place And not like Amazon or anything,1,Negative
544,2544,No but that would be an interesting class action lawsuit,2,Neutral
545,2545,Im in the UK and the only communication Ive had from Samsung regarding all of was a txt from carphone warehouse saying that Samsung is recalling the phone,1,Negative
546,2546,Got the email today from samsung stating this Beginning Thursday October 13th Samsung Note7 owners can bring their device to the original Samsung or authorized reseller point of purchase to Exchange towards a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge device Receive a refund for the Note7 device and Note7 specific accessoriesSo yea they mention Note7 specific accessories I live in canada btw not sure if this applies everywhere else,1,Negative
547,2547,Ive done this as well for all accessories I bought,3,Positive
548,2548,I bought a funbag sleeve for my Note 7 on Amazon and as of now its a waste of 25 Its an import from Germany but the build quality is spectacular Hopefully my Edge will fight it in well enough for me to not want to send it back,3,Positive
549,2549,Amazon Italy refused refund and told me to fuck off since end period is 30 days not 40 On a sealedunused original Samsung leather case,1,Negative
550,2550,I messaged one of the places that sold me a note 7 case and they said the 30 day return period had passed Then I messaged Amazon and they made me start an a to z guarantee claim against the seller which they did for me I got my money back by the end of today,1,Negative
551,2551,Pretty sure being that they dont even show the phone on their website anymore Plus a lot of their accessories are being removed,2,Neutral
552,2552,hi everybody its interesting to know about Note 7 is this project has closed or Samsung try to reanimate it,2,Neutral
553,2553,Seems like an automated error Definitely keep what you have dont count on the note 7 to come back Even if it did I wouldnt waste my time again testing it out,0,Verynegative
554,2554,I have big hands and i use mine with one hand with no issues D but yeah if you dont have huge hands i guess that would be an issue,1,Negative
555,2555,Dawg this is why you try a phone before you buy it I love my edge,1,Negative
556,2556,c,2,Neutral
557,2557,Because that isnt what you think it is The edge panel is simply a quick access menu that you can drag icons to Disabling it only disables the menu and not the actual touch screen aspect of the edges,1,Negative
558,2558,The edges feel better when you have a case on the phone,3,Positive
559,2559,I dont have a problem i got used to it after a week getting bigger hands is your only option Its fixed on the N7 but its no longer an option,1,Negative
560,2560,They are fucking awful curved displays are a gimmick,1,Negative
561,2561,I am actually frustrated by the curved edge too Glad to know I am not alone,1,Negative
562,2562,Ive turned the Edge Panels completely off but as far as I know those are just the notification bars and dont actually turn the touch screen aspect off Do you know of any cases that maybe cover it up a bit,1,Negative
563,2563,I havent had any issues either but I have large hands My GF really wants the S7 Edge but Ive been trying to talk her out of it and go for the regular S7 Her hands are smaller so I believe she will have edge touching issues and she drops her phone a lot I just forsee a cracked screen in her future,1,Negative
564,2564,My case prevents accidental edge touching Ive handed it off to friends to look at something without issues I saw a coworker today with a cracked screen S7 edge with no case on it so I think its fair to assume you probably dont have a case on it for some reason If you want to use it 1 handed there are some cool cases with silicon ish finger loops that help My friend does that with his 6s he loves it and says it doesnt really bother him if its in his pocket and the loop helps navigate a giant phone with 1 hand,1,Negative
565,2565,This is what happens when a company cares more for a gimmick look instead of usability Yes the Edge looks cool but is not practical at all,2,Neutral
566,2566,I know Its so frustrating I can either have a hideous case on the phone or not be able to use it one handed What a shitty design,1,Negative
567,2567,Damn this is a bad bad bad experience What phone will you be switching to,1,Negative
568,2568,Get another phone in the meantime and bring it back with you in December When you get passed security have a ziploc bag already with you and then fill it with water and drop the phone in there for safety Then return for an exchange at T Mobile store,1,Negative
569,2569,and the fact that the airline would not allow me to bring it with me back to the US not even in checked luggage according to them There is no ban on flying with the phone you just cant power it up or charge it while on the plane There IS a specific ban against putting it in checked luggage though because there is always the worry that the phone will be jostled around and will be powered up unattended and then overheat inside your luggage,1,Negative
570,2570,P S that all sounds frustrating as fuck,1,Negative
571,2571,Apples idea if making it feel like a click is great this is what I think Samsung needs to copy a fourcetouch button,1,Negative
572,2572,If its good id be fine with it but itd be hard for it to be as good as the real thing,3,Positive
573,2573,I agree that having the screen extending to all 4 edges would be cool but you wouldnt have anywhere on the front of the device that you can hold and I bet there would be a hell of a lot of accidental touches Although this is coming from a guy who bought the edge variant so Id buy it anyway haha,1,Negative
574,2574,Dont forget reachability two light taps for iPhone three clicks for the Note Lotta functions to ask for from one button It would be nice to not have to depress the button with the Notes stylus however,2,Neutral
575,2575,I dont expect Samsung would have a sufficient tactile response like the iPhone 7 which is debatable if it is sufficient with a button Just having capacitive buttons I wouldnt mind but at that point Id prefer just having onscreen buttons,1,Negative
576,2576,I was skeptical at first but I bought the iphone 7 and the home button on it was really well done Kinda left me amazed actually I ended up returning the phone after 3 days because everything else was just meh and I hated the closed ecosystem but I miss that home button They managed to really simulate the feel of a click with haptic feedback So bottom line I would be all for this feature if similarly well executed replacing a physical home button on any and every phone its that well done,1,Negative
577,2577,Interesting take although ive never actually had a button wear out on me before,3,Positive
578,2578,I hate the plastic Ive had the S7 since launch and there are a few dents in the home button,1,Negative
579,2579,I wouldnt mind it I use the vibration feedback for the back and recents buttons whats one more,1,Negative
580,2580,either they make on screen button or physical home button non clicky button sucks,1,Negative
581,2581,I really like the physical home button I like physical buttons for a lot of things,1,Negative

588,2588,Mine is better as well,3,Positive
589,2589,Been on my phone all day and havent charged it at all now on 40 battery life is much better,1,Negative
590,2590,Ive noticed a significant change and Im not even at the rate of apps I had on the first version of the Note7,1,Negative
591,2591,that maybe the case this battery definitely feels like it pails in comparison to the original one,1,Negative
592,2592,Mine is worse Im using a Tmobile varient I just got it replaced 2 days ago on Saturday and spent all Sunday setting it up to be an exact clone as my old one in regards to apps which ones are on power saver settings and the layout Today was my first work day having the phone I work from 8 to 6 its in standby most of the day besides my breaks and a few sneak peeks at social media and stuff With my old phone I used to be able to be in the low 70 area by the time 6 00 rolls around Today at 6 my replacement phone was at 51,0,Verynegative
593,2593,I went from 100 20 in 9 hours including a lot of Pokemon Go n stuff,2,Neutral

598,2598,MST is hardware so the Gear S2 will never have MST unless they release an updated S2 It does have Samsung pay with NFC though,1,Negative
599,2599,no,1,Negative
600,2600,Price probably wont drop The s3 is an addition to the gear s line Its it replacing the gear s2,1,Negative
601,2601,Check on Swappa Ill probably list my classic up there when I get the new Gear S3,1,Negative
602,2602,I dont think itll drop permanently mostly cuz the Gear S3 i feel are just additional watches available to choose from just like when the Platinum and Rose Gold classics came out The S3 are bigger watches and so some people might not wan na buy it cuz they have smaller wrists Most likely itll just go on sale Source I work at Best Buy,1,Negative
603,2603,Since Samsung seems to be looking to sell the original S2 alongside the new range I wouldnt be surprised to see a price drop the same time pricing and availability for the S3 is announced I wouldnt expect a major RRP drop from Samsung though as they may not want it to seem too much of a bargain against the S3 but retailers may differ in strategy On a side note I was holding off getting the classic on contract with O2 UK in anticipation of new models and have noticed its no longer an option on their website Im hoping that means the S3 isnt too far away Although I would have quite happily gone with the classic knowing the new ones arent that much of a major upgrade Id hope Samsung would bring the software enhancements to the S2 Eventually,1,Negative

623,2623,I just ordered and was told theyre being overnighted,1,Negative
624,2624,Didnt this sites owner get hired by Apple The sites founder left to work for Apple and sold off the site so theres no conflict of interest He has no remaining involvement and newer employees like myself have never even met him Are there any specific aspects of the review you find unfair that justify your assessment of the review as biased,1,Negative
625,2625,Eh I take it for what it is This one reviewers take was good to middling You cant please everyone If good is the worst review I have read today that is alright with me Most of the other reviews have been overwhelmingly positive,2,Neutral
626,2626,Normally Im not one for all the fluff but Im there to see the benchmarks on things since they do a good job on that note The opinionated bit did irk me though,1,Negative
627,2627,Praise for the HTC 10 is probably from the fact that the author is in the middle of reviewing that device and had to drop what he was doing to push out a Note 7 review before going back to it Might just be what he compares it to since that is the other device he is most recently working with,1,Negative
628,2628,The CNET review on 5 reasons not to buy the Note 7 was trash Those were horrible reasons,1,Negative
629,2629,Sorry not sure from legal perspective But its Samsung brand store as said on www samsung com about my shop It sells only samsung devices and there is no any different brand or label on this shop except Samsung,1,Negative

631,2631,No way I got a mate who just brought this camera AND his brother has a 3D printerNO WAY this guys called Henry too what a coincidence Oh,2,Neutral
632,2632,I too have a 6S Plus and Im about to switch back Im torn on either getting the S7e or the Note 7 I was going to wait on the Note 7 but the way the specs are laying out I may just go with the 7 edge,1,Negative
633,2633,Good move You wont regret it Stop being so limited by apple ooops,3,Positive
634,2634,Why switch I switched from the 5s to a lg g3 because the audio book support on the iPhone was fantastically shitty A few things to consider before switching iPhones hold there value way longer Apple seamlessly syncs your stuff Android does it but its a bit of work to set up Google play and iTunes for audio are way different and much like the syncing its going to take some work for it work like iTunes IOS is less laggy all around G3 to 5s was rough S7 edge to iPhone 6 not as much difference but noticeable edit Nothing like giving out advice to get downvoted,1,Negative
635,2635,The Google Play Store will have just about any app youre looking for Its pretty straightforward apps in categories and there are plenty of options for anything you might be trying to do As far as rooting goes the Android equivalent to jailbreak it means you and apps you specify have root access meaning if you wanted you could delete your system folder and watch the phone die but its super easy to restoreinstall ROMs on most Samsung phones as easy as flashing a ZIP file from your SD card and if I recall correctly the ATampT and T Mobile versions are rootable thanks to a leaked developer bootloader or something However its been a few weeks since Ive looked into any of that as all my attention has been on the unannounced Galaxy Note7,1,Negative
636,2636,I made the switch from my iPhone 5s to s7 edge at the beginning of the month And Im glad I did The display is so nice Camera is amazing as well Its a sleek looking phone too I havent changed much on the phone I think its good as it is But there is so much you can do I like the info Google provides to you and learning the system was easy Moving my music over was easy enough too The only thing I miss is imessage And its really not a big deal because all my friends use WhatsApp I think Samsung makes a nice phone and I would do it again,3,Positive
637,2637,Thats a good point Thanks for the suggestion,3,Positive
638,2638,Im not thrilled about the note being offered in the edge variety,1,Negative
639,2639,Are you going to keep the screen naked now or try a film protector,2,Neutral
640,2640,Really was I jumped on the S7E even though it appeared it would never be rooted And to be quite honest I thought it wouldnt be but here we are Those guys did awesome work,1,Negative
641,2641,The glance option is really cool,3,Positive
642,2642,I wonder how the performane is,2,Neutral
643,2643,These are baby steps towards a non Google phone Mark my words,2,Neutral
644,2644,This is on the Note5 Title is misleading,1,Negative
645,2645,The search bar in the notification shade is pretty cool This is actually the first feasible way of replacing the app drawer I have seen,3,Positive
646,2646,Thanks hopefully thats better than my fitbits sleep tracker I didnt get much use out of that one although I was really hoping to like it,1,Negative
647,2647,Ive been using S Health with it The GPS tracker seemed to work pretty accurately during a hike where I left my phone in the car I wasnt sure if itd still track or not but it sure did GPS mapping elevation heart rate steps etc The Gear S2 is pretty awesome I had all intentions of selling it when it came in but I couldnt resist opening the package to play with it for a bit After downloading a bunch of watch faces and customizing it a bit Im hooked People are surprised how clear the calls are too Its nice for the quick reply txts when Im busy,1,Negative
648,2648,You had to pre order the phone and register for the promotion back in March,2,Neutral
649,2649,I just got mine yesterday and Ive been fiddling around with it Trying to get used to milk music app,1,Negative
650,2650,I recommend the app Toggles Widget It allows you to change your phone settings such as WiFi silentvibrate mode NFC Bluetooth etc Add it to your widget screen and itll allow for easy access to silent your phone quickly before a meeting for example It costs two bucks but is well worth it in my opinion It shouldve been a standard feature on the watch Casia is an elegant watch face that offers a lot of nice features for free My current watch face which costs a dollar is the Fusion Watch Face which I think is very sleek and nice looking Try turning on your always on display if youd like Itll impact your battery slightly but I still end everyday with about 30 to 40 left so its not bad at all,3,Positive
651,2651,Ill definitely get a lot of use out the S Health app I like the one on the phone good enough but I think itll be more accurate with the watch And thanks for the warning about the notifications,2,Neutral
652,2652,Source,2,Neutral
653,2653,You can really see how the Huawei captures better pictures in very dark places You can also notice that dark areas in bright images are brighter than the GS7,2,Neutral
654,2654,I think that the final results are very similar Where one phone has a white haze on a photo other phone has it on a different one Where Huawei excels and not only with P9 are night photos they know very well how to work with street light I tend towards the P9 being slightly better but when they anncouned the dual camera I expected the results to be better than this,1,Negative
655,2655,I prefer the s7 except for that parking lot picture towards the beginning,2,Neutral
656,2656,It looks like he has finger grease on the lens on some of those night shots,1,Negative

660,2660,Ive seen this happen before The clicking mechanism on the pen is stuck all the way in What I did was got some double sticky tape and worked it out with that,1,Negative
661,2661,This isnt the first time its gotten stuck in there the pop up end sticks on my s pen but normally I can just pop it out by catching an edge with my pocket knife Today though it seems to have pushed deeper into my phone somehow Its about 2 3mm deep I cant get so much as a safety pin into it Any ideas The phone works fine still but I quite like having the pen available to me,1,Negative
662,2662,its immersive a pity about the screendoor effect though,1,Negative
663,2663,Thank you ordering right now i was scared about that huge blakc border from screen captures on youtube but i guess theres no way to actually recreate what it feels like to wear it realistically,1,Negative
664,2664,When I tried it I was more into 360 pictures under the ocean than I was the Cirque Du Soleil demo I couldnt get into the controls in the brief time I had it on I could definitely see myself watching movies though and trying some games,1,Negative
665,2665,I wouldnt count on the Samsung store getting it to you any faster I have been waiting for a micro SD card from them that was and still is listed as in stock for nearly a month Their online store has terrible customer service literally zero help it makes no sense since they are so big,1,Negative

670,2670,I think the dial is good and it was nice to find new music They came a bit late and now the market for streaming music is saturated Pandora Spotify Google amp Apple music have already made their names and Id rather they just fold into another service than drag it out,2,Neutral

677,2677,Amazon cause I usually pick them up for next to nothing or free with discounts,1,Negative
678,2678,the cell phone booth im clumsy as fuck and normally drop it within 20 min of getting it,1,Negative
679,2679,eBay because its the only place I could find a basic bumper It arrived I liked it so I immediately ordered 3 more For my previous device N4 I went through a bumper about every year so Im stocked up for the expected life of my S6,1,Negative
680,2680,Ebay or Amazon because price,2,Neutral

682,2682,Spigen from eBay Cheap,1,Negative
683,2683,Best prices and reviews prime two day shipping Spigenwas awesome but for the note 5 they got pulled even newegg pulled note 5 spigen brand at least a few days ago they did Recommend the icarer leather case for note 5 20 and its slim fitting and very soft on the phone Shell is also soft and wont scratch phone when it is placed in,3,Positive
684,2684,I got an Otterbox Symmetry for my edge it really surprised me how low profile and sleek it is and how much protection it adds to the phone I got mine from Bell only because I didnt want to wait for shipping and risk dropping my phone while waiting for the case,1,Negative
685,2685,EBay because its way cheaper than the absurd prices charged by most other retailers,1,Negative
686,2686,Im 28 and an authorised user on my mothers account for ATT She retired from ATT and gets 40 phone cases and screen protectors I dont know what else,1,Negative

690,2690,Try Diztronic I have them on all my families phones and theyre amazing,3,Positive
691,2691,I dig the Spigen cases but Amazons S7 Edge selection for Spigen cases is weak Theyre priced 35 40 on Spigens official site but I picked up two 40 cases for 10 each on Spigens official eBay store,1,Negative

693,2693,Amazon awesome selection for next to nothing,1,Negative
694,2694,What are the other reasons for returning And what are you switching to,2,Neutral
695,2695,Hmmm I hadnt noticed this before it does respond to the activation phrase while on a charger Unfortunately for me I use a secure lock screen required if you use a VPN or if you want to be able to use Samsung Pay which are both true for me and although I do get the Google Now listening dialog it forces me to unlock the screen before processing my command Kind of defeats the purpose of an always listening mode,1,Negative
696,2696,The thing I was most after is for it to work while the screen is off like iOS hey siri works when the phone screen is off and Ive been using that loads,1,Negative
697,2697,Seems like theyve screwed current users just to take advantage and launch Samsung Pay simultaneously with the S7,1,Negative
698,2698,MST is integrated into the hardware So I believe it is mostly likely to work,3,Positive
699,2699,Hey Samsung can you move a little bit more to the left and add support for Portugal too,2,Neutral

705,2705,That was what I liked the most about this Im glad its slowly gaining some support,2,Neutral
706,2706,Its a start at least Plus you have better chances of store sales on these than the mendini ones,1,Negative
707,2707,Ive always thought that samsung should just make an adapter like what apple did with the apple watch,1,Negative
708,2708,Do I just tell them what the problem is and theyll replace it just like that Will they replace it on the spot or will it take them a while to deliver it,2,Neutral
709,2709,Looks like theres some burn in above the keyboard too Looks a little like a messaging app the way its laid out,1,Negative
710,2710,I dont see anything but its probably a result of the screen being AMOLED They experience burn in Theres really not a way to fix it the way to mitigate it is to try as run the display in a negative mode if possible,1,Negative
711,2711,Screen burn Screen has had very high brightness setting and been on a lot another telling thing is the green hue around the screen,1,Negative
712,2712,Its just some screen burn inretention my S7 has it bad near the notification bar all my Samsung phones end up with it nothing really you can do about it They make some apps that supposedly fix it but Ive yet to find one that really works,1,Negative
713,2713,Ok at least now I know what it is at least thanks guys Kind of upset that I cant get it fixed but at least I know its not bad or anything,1,Negative
714,2714,I noticed that the keyboard is somehow on my screen The keyboard doesnt really do anything it just bothers me Also I couldnt screenshot it so I had to use my iPad to take a pic Does anyone know what it is and how to fix it I have a galaxy s7 edge btw,1,Negative
715,2715,Thats strange that you would have screen burn in already from an S7e I have a note 4 I use all the time and no SBI Id try to get it fixed under warranty Did you turn off your screen timeout or something,1,Negative
716,2716,Yea boyyyyyy,2,Neutral
717,2717,The specs seems good on paper but if I were you Id hold out until s8 comes because Im sure it would be more better plus the possibility of note variant in the S series Plus dont expect too much on their non flagship phones Youll get what you pay for though,1,Negative
718,2718,No This has a slower midrange processor bigger camera aperture lower resolution screen no iris scanner no wireless charging no waterproofing,1,Negative

721,2721,The alternative could be a BBQ in your pants hahaha,2,Neutral
722,2722,The glue between the layers of glass in the screen is coming apart It happens sometimes but needs to be replaced Warranty should cover it if there are no signs of abuse,1,Negative
723,2723,Dude go to best buy and request an RMA You said it yourself you have a warranty,1,Negative
724,2724,Ran out of watches Thats to be expected So its between a microsd card and a gearvr Better value is probably the micro SD card When they get enough inventory again and work through the recalled units Id expect a similar or better promo After all they cant afford not to sell units theyre already spending 1B on the recall so they might as well put 10 30M into a post recall discount promo campaign so new customers buy a Note 7 or are interested in an S8 Without continued momentum beyond the recall major market share is in jeopardy Which is why they spent 1B on the recall immediate They cant afford not to,1,Negative
725,2725,Looks like they changed it,2,Neutral
726,2726,It will let me use the search function but it will just turn up with No Apps found matching Insert app name here,1,Negative

729,2729,I would recommend that I havent heard anything else from anyone about this but knowing what came of it for me I would just hold off Not worth the hassle in my opinion,1,Negative
730,2730,Man they literally sent the cheapest one I already had a 250gb ssd thats why i really wanted a bigger one I would never buy a 120 lol,1,Negative
731,2731,I hope so too but i really dont know how i can prove it if they dont believe me The only possible way to prove it would be if i was videotaping myself opening the box but who the hell does that,1,Negative

796,2796,Is the android system drain a bug that you guys think will be fixed or part of the process when you first get your phone and it goes away after lke a week Because when I had my 6p that would be nowhere near the top I am coming from a 2014 moto x so im used to pluggin into my 20100 ravpower qc 2 0 power bank often i can live with it but id like to think my battery life could improve as 3000mah is not bad its only 450 under the 6p so it should be comparible And I dont use alway on display only the notificatino LED,1,Negative

800,2800,im thinking s7 edge from my note 5 I rarely use my stylus,1,Negative
801,2801,Ive had the s6 edge for a year It looks far superior That being said its a pain in the ass to pickup and text in one hand Maybe I have inordinately inbred small hands I much prefer the look of the s7 edge but with the extra size I can see me throwing it all over the place constantly If the silver version was available in the UK Id take that and swallow the annoyingness of constantly dropping it but seeing as its black or gold I pre ordered the standard s7 and the more I look at it the better a choice it is looking Im hoping the looks are a grower,1,Negative
802,2802,So you want a note without a stylus,2,Neutral
803,2803,Im getting edge for the possibility of using such a large phone one handed most of the time thanks to the edge panel I have small hands and my 4 7 phone is too big now and pretty much all flagship phones on offer are bigger than that so Im looking to the edge display to put things in reach Plus I liked the edge in the s6 so Im finally giving in,1,Negative
804,2804,I am happy with my decision and Im loving the s7 edge The iPhone SE was not what I was looking for and hopefully the iPhone 7 coming in fall 2016 will appeal to me the same as the SE,1,Negative

807,2807,Not OP but I am moving from the IPhone 6 to GS7 Edge Its got the speed camera quality looks and hopefully battery life Im looking for The Edge may not be that useful from a practicality standpoint but it is undeniably cool and gives a different look then every plain slab of glass Im holding out hope for a multitask edge mode similar to the apps edge but with dynamic timelocation based or with open apps populating it,1,Negative

811,2811,I have the Galaxy Note 5 and Ill be trading it in for the S7 Its cause I prefer having a smaller phone The SPen is nice but I dont really need it Plus expandable storage is something I needed more than I thought My first phone was an S3 which lasted almost 4 years,1,Negative
812,2812,I preordered the s7 edge simply because Im bored with current devices and want something different,1,Negative
813,2813,I went into best buy today with the mindset that I would definitely pre order the S7 Edge After i played around with them both i changed my mind and i pre ordered the regular S7 The big phone with the curved screen felt awkward in my hand and the side swiping didnt work as well as I expected it would and I cant think of when Id ever use it to be honest Im glad I went in to check them out in person and I recommend anyone considering pre ordering to do the same Both phones have the same camera and its AMAZING Puts my LG G4 camera to shame in a side by side test actually or maybe the photos just look a lot better on the improved screen of the Samsung On a side note the Samsung Gear VR is pretty neat I get it free with a current t mobile promotion Its probably one of those things I use a lot at first and never touch again but oh well,1,Negative
814,2814,I like the S7 better than the Edge edge features are useless for me and still feel gimmick Only reason I will pick the edge is because of 3600 mah battery over 3000 with the S7,1,Negative
815,2815,Ill wait for the Note 6,2,Neutral
816,2816,If the edge had more ram or better processor I would Bigger battery edge screen simply isnt worth it to me Ill be getting the s7,1,Negative
817,2817,Planning on getting the S7 to replace my N5 Biggest draw to the S7 is wireless charging and expandable memory I kept going back and forth between the 7 and the 7 edge but i dont really have a use for the edge extras and i kinda like the 5 ish inch size phones i dont have a need for a larger phone so yeah,1,Negative
818,2818,I pre ordered the S7 I think it just fits better in my hands than the S7 edge The edge looks better especially the silver one omg but for everyday use I think Ill get annoyed of the size,1,Negative

838,2838,Its possible you may have installed something that had adware built in The easiest way to remove it is to do a factory reset It clears everything from your phone and it goes back to a state as If your phone is brand new so before you factory reset it look through the settings and find an option that says backup and reset save everything that is important to you either on a cloud storage or to your computer,1,Negative
