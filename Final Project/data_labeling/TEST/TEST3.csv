2,2002,Having owned Samsungs since the first galaxy I can tell you that Ive only had issues with one and that was the s3 and that was my fault I dropped it 3 times not in a row down iron bark stairs After a while it just stopped working This was around the time the s5 came out and I bought an s5 not long after Ive now moved onto the s7 edge but my s5 is onto a new owner and still working fine Owning a samsung is like owning a desktop You have to care for it delete old shit watch out for nasty surprises and keep the skin flicks to a minimum,1,Negative

64,2064,I have the S7 Edge since its launching day Works like a charm and by far the best phone Ive ever used minus the Note 7 which I have used for few weeks before having to return it Ive tried several other Android phones and never found anything better than Samsung One advice I would give would be to keep the device memory usage below 80,1,Negative

90,2090,Woke up and took it off the charger Are you charging over night with the fast charger That could be a large part of your problem right there A lot of android phones dont automatically stop charging at 100 especially if they are fast charging You may have overcharged your battery,1,Negative
91,2091,Ive also just started experience an extreme battery drain on my Galaxy S6 Edge today Really not sure what the issue is Battery seems to be reporting a heavy use of Google Services but Im curious if it has anything to do with the recent update that came out a few days ago Im on Verizon Its reached 20 twice today so far and Im barely using it It usually lasts through the workday at about 60 but its nowhere near that today Its also noticeably more hot to the touch today Battery seems to be in overdrive for whatever reason Restarting the phone didnt help either,1,Negative

95,2095,It could be this it was happening to me this morning Uninstalling the Oculus app fixed it immediately,1,Negative
96,2096,You could try thisIf youre experiencing overheating even when not using or charging your phone it could be down to a particular app Luckily the Battery optimiser setting allows you to stop apps from sapping energy when the phone isnt in use Go to Settings Battery Battery Usage More Optimise battery usage and tap All Apps Doing this will stop apps from working in the background even when youre not using the phone If overheating persists you can try wiping the cache partition With your Galaxy S7 turned off press and hold the Power Home and Volume Up buttons together until you see the Samsung logo and then release This launches the S7 s Android system recovery mode Tap the Volume Down button to scroll down the list of options and then select Cache Partition by pressing the Power button If all else fails a factory reset might be in order If that proves unsuccessful its time to return the S7 to Samsung for a replacement,1,Negative
97,2097,In another thread someone said that having the Gear VR app installed was causing this,1,Negative
98,2098,My Galaxy S7 Edge did indeed overheat using the charger that came with the unit the adaptive fast charger My wifes unit also gets hot to the touch while charging As a result of my unit overheating it discolored and pitted the area around the Home Button very close to the charger connection I was given a reference number then received an email that my complaint was without merit I offered to send a pic while on chat and she said okay but never asked further Nowwith the bs update I have a two 600 useless paperweights I am pissed,1,Negative
99,2099,It looks like the phone was put on a hotplate The battery hasnt vented so thats not what caused it And it only seems to be melted around the edges those in which would be the first to touch a hot plate or frying pan on an oven I say this because the CPU which is what generates the most heat in the device is located in the center by the camera not the outer edges of the phone I think someone just tried to pull a fast one to get their phone replaced on you,1,Negative

145,2145,Well I mean its usually quicker for me to either pay in cash or hand them a card So I rationalized the added step of dealing with loading the app was that if I used it 5 times Id get a good reward Now you have to use it like a lot to get any reward I mean I could have seen them scale it back a little be like OK you need to use it 10 times then maybe 20 etc etc But they went from like 5 times for like 6 months or so to like 50,1,Negative

155,2155,I keep hearing all these claims of from what Ive seen and mine has scratches and all I did is put it in my pocket and I believed the hype and have gotten more paranoid But Ive seen little picture evidence to support the claims Outside of display models the JRE video and a couple random pics on the net where are all the pics Ive also heard multiple reports of no scratches from everyday commuters to construction workers but like all things the negatives seem to get the most attention Ive had mine since day one with a case covering the back and naked on the front Ive been careful probably over protective and I have no scratches Yet Fingers crossed but Im beginning to think the sky isnt falling,1,Negative
156,2156,The back of the phone isnt as strong as the front of the phone I use to have an iphone that was all glass and it scratched like crazy The important thing is I learned to go commando and not care about cases anymore Sure my GS5 looks like its been through war but Ive enjoyed its beauty everyday for the past 2 years without it being wrapped around a giant condom,1,Negative

213,2213,I mainly use my Apple Watch for reminders Does the Gear S2 show reminders from your phone What about Gear VR Is it as good as they say,1,Negative
214,2214,The Gear S2 is a pretty cool watch easier to navigate around with the circle dial vs the crown thing on Apple The only challenge is there are fewer apps but who needs so many specific apps on a watch anyway,1,Negative
215,2215,What phone did you switch from,2,Neutral
216,2216,i did the same thing I had every iPhone since the 2g but this phone is clearly in a league of its own I actually havent bought a watch yet since the always on display is actually nice If I do I will get the Huawei watch since I hated the moto 360,1,Negative

221,2221,Im really hoping they reintroduce expandable storage That was one of their strongest selling points imo and I dont know why they went away from that,1,Negative

228,2228,I didnt have a Note before and I ordered A Note 7 from Verizon a few hours ago The order status has an expected ship date of 920 I guess they are available to everybody now,1,Negative
229,2229,Whats all this Im hearing about a 1021 relaunch date then,1,Negative
230,2230,Awesome As someone looking to upgrade to it Ive not heard much about the re release so this got me pretty excited,1,Negative
231,2231,Is there going to be any kind of promotion or bonus to bring people back to the Note 7 I am considering getting one now that the battery issue is over but dont want to miss out on any special offers,1,Negative
232,2232,So should I turn off my onky means of communication while I am on vacation and need it Wtf,1,Negative
233,2233,I brought mine back today and got the S7 Edge Not worth waiting months for a replacement when mine could catch fire,1,Negative

237,2237,Me No,2,Neutral
238,2238,Yes but resells are different from retail sales Resells could be the result of stolen phones,2,Neutral
239,2239,Interesting Typically the warranty does not apply to anyone except the original owner not you in this situation bc you bought it on swappa However this is not a warranty issue Supposedly even devices damaged from drops etc will be replaced within reason Dont know why they wouldnt replace one that was bought through a 3rd party If worst comes to worst go to www bestbuy comnote7info and sign up for updates And go to the carrier store and tell them you bought it out of town or something to that effect On another note who TF buyssells a 2 week old phone on swappa edit words,1,Negative
240,2240,That wont work I tried it once last year Told them it was a birthday gift but they wouldnt budge The person who originally purchased it under their account had to be present I even tried doing it via online chat and was told the same thing,1,Negative
241,2241,Cos thats so easy and risk free s,2,Neutral
242,2242,Makes sense,2,Neutral
243,2243,Since Verizon occasionally does open enrollment for phone insurance thatll probably be your only way of hopefully getting onto a newer revision However then youre at the mercy of Asurions stock quality The few times Ive used them I havent had any major issues but theres usually someone out there with a bad Asurion experience,1,Negative
244,2244,Yeah Id contact the CPSC,1,Negative

248,2248,Shouldnt you read the post and realize that he said he would have called except its Memorial Day and therefore he cant,2,Neutral
249,2249,Well of youre willing to trust the device with information like bank accounts and card information you better hope they have everything secure with no possible intrusions So maybe waiting is better then having a feature that comes with a great risk,3,Positive
250,2250,Return it as Not fit for purpose if the watch was advertised as havingor going to have soon a feature and doesnt then the watch as it stands isnt fit for purpose,1,Negative
251,2251,I know youre joking but still hate you for getting my hopes up,1,Negative
252,2252,I mentiond this in another thread about the same issue Samsung pay was one of the things they advertised with the Gear S2 They also advertised MapMyRun intergration as a premier partner So I bought the watch Then I learned that they lied about Samsung Pay as it wasnt actually available for the watch Then I learned that MapMyRun actually wasnt available either with no plans of ever actually making it available in the future The Nike intergration is absolute shit and has tons of problems so its nearly useless And there are no other alternatives since the app store is a total and complete joke Basically you can get watch faces on the store Thats it Most everything else is junk I think I bought my last Samsung watch Tizen isnt going to be taking off anytime soon but they refuse to let it go,1,Negative
253,2253,Thanks,2,Neutral

256,2256,I think 30 is the best well get for a while and its a good deal I just dont want to start another credit card just to use it Bank support is more important than promotions,3,Positive
257,2257,I registeredadded a card yesterday amp I am not seeing the promotion under personalized offers Anyone else having issues,1,Negative
258,2258,AMEX is allowed Along with Citi Chase and Wells Fargo,1,Negative
259,2259,This is as good as any of the deals Ive seen them run this year I dont see any reason to wait and hope for a better one because youll be waiting at least two months as thats how long this promotion is going Its a really convenient way to pay,2,Neutral
260,2260,Youve bruised your phone,2,Neutral
261,2261,Your LCD is broken so the only solution is to replace it This happened to my wifes S4 so I paid a repair place 80 to install new screen and LCD and it was good as new,1,Negative
262,2262,Mine did that It eventually turned green after resetting it The phone is piss weak,1,Negative
263,2263,It will still plug into a pc fine backup all your info pics contacts etc A replacement screen for s4 when I looked was about 120 quid and isnt too bad a job as the lcd unit in its entirety needs replacing replacing just the glass is waaaaay more complicated Getting someone to replace my screen for me e g Carphone Warehouse was more like 160 quid and they will completely reset to manufacturer settings Good luck,1,Negative
264,2264,Any chance you have a picture think I am having a similar issue,2,Neutral
265,2265,Im sorry Your fone is kill,1,Negative

268,2268,That looks a hell of a lot like Type C to me I think its just the angle but only time will tell,1,Negative
269,2269,From that angle it looks a lot like a Type C After I got my Nexus 6P I actually dont mind the Type C The faster charging is my primary advantage As long as Samsung does what Google does and includes a charging cable but a Type A to Type C cable I have no complaints,1,Negative
270,2270,She is obviously an Apple fanboy In this article she compares the S6 and iPhone 6S and says that the iPhone wins in the features department simply because of 3D touch She does mention that the S6 has a heartrate monitor infrared transmitter and wireless charging but those are just mentioned as an afterthought as if they have no value whatsoever,1,Negative
271,2271,It looks like its written by an apple fanboy,2,Neutral
272,2272,He is no doubt paid by Apple This is a worthless article You could make the same argument picking an android phone with a better battery than the ip6 and say well you better switch platforms,1,Negative
273,2273,11 hours of web browsing12 hours of video playbackI fucking wish lol,1,Negative
274,2274,This article literally says nothing relevant whatsoever Considering the only real thing its comparing is battery life the iPhone 6 is still sad in every other category,1,Negative
275,2275,feels like it the way the writer uses the word anyhow just makes it seem more opinionated rather than informative especially as it does state it is better than other android competitors,1,Negative

280,2280,Somebody has to take the blame SDI is still apart of Samsungs brand though,2,Neutral
281,2281,Accurate title I guess but this was my thought Samsung is finger pointing and may be at the end of a lawsuit because of it Samsung was quick to blame the battery for causing some Note 7 devices to catch fire but it has since widened its investigation after replacement phones using batteries from Chinas Amperex Technology also caught fire,1,Negative
282,2282,Why is the thumbnail BestBuy PRC stickers,1,Negative
283,2283,I alternate between 2 themes Android N and Grace UXBut i think grace ux was pulled from the theme store,2,Neutral
284,2284,I love the themes but I havent paid for any yet My favorite free themes are called Alien Theme Vintage Mountains Whale Live Pug Retro and Impressionism If I were going to pay for themes I would have a hard time choosing between Poppy Retro Cafe Theme and V window theyre super lovely Theres also one called MaterialisticUI that looks like what Daredevils Matt Murdock would look like if he were trapped inside a phone theme,1,Negative

291,2291,Galaxy S7E has the same issue,2,Neutral
292,2292,Strange my S7 edge is pretty snappy when it comes to multitasking,2,Neutral
293,2293,The practical application is when you go to show someone a photo and it takes 27 seconds to wake up the device and open Gallery Then when you go to scroll through all your photos there is a delay While I dont think this is going to be the same level problem as I had with my S6 Active on Lollipop I still think it is important to let the manufacturer know that it is something that should be addressed as if they dont already know,1,Negative
294,2294,While it would be nice for it to have the memory to go back to where it left off this doesnt put me off of getting Note I have tried a Note and iPhone and given both a try Note 7 please I just cant do iPhone I dont like the ios or anything really Not my cup of tea Plus the Note 7 has much more use behind it than the hardware I have found In my book the Note still leads for me because I have other needs for it that iPhone does not have,2,Neutral
295,2295,Note 5 user here if you watch through to the second round the user opens the apps a second time and on the Note 7 they have to reload completely into memory,1,Negative
296,2296,So your saying a program that is written to benchmark Apple products doesnt properly benchmark a Samsung product Go ahead and try to argue the whole IOS and Android app thing and youll be wrong because Apple holds everything from its hardware to the software that it runs on Samsung makes the hardware and then adds its own flavor to the software that Google maintains Completely different it isnt an Apples to Apples comparison Try comparing it to another Android phone instead youd be allot closer Dang 8 years and we are still having this argument,0,Verynegative
297,2297,Honestly these tests are useless for me becaues I dont care about a few seconds,1,Negative
298,2298,Wonder whats the next excuse after iphone wins the same test with Note 7 running 1080p or 720p,1,Negative
299,2299,Cant be worse than the note 5 if not Ill take the storage expansion and bad ram management over my note 5 all day My phone isnt my overclocking gaming rig and benchmarking my phone is not important to me I dont need it to render video or run over clocked for 8 hours on aida64 or prime 95 with ihigh temperatures Some people really buy phones for reasons other than calling and media Like more important reasons like benchmarking Need to make a sub for that Or is that the Sony Xperia forum or some other foreign brand that doesnt usually work for american carriers,0,Verynegative
300,2300,Ah yes for all the times I want to open and then immediately close all of the apps on my homescreen,1,Negative
301,2301,Exactly this the first disappointment for me was that the Galaxy Note 7 comes with the same specs as S7E but I still hoped that with Grace they will fix the ram managment issue and was proven wrong,0,Verynegative

303,2303,Very poor comparison would you buy a computer if it had the same performance,1,Negative
304,2304,This is probably the best description of phone speed Ive read As you can see the difference between these rival flagships is really negligible While the iPhone 6 proved to be ever so slightly quicker at loading some apps the S6 Edge was quicker at loading others But in each case there was only milliseconds between the two,1,Negative

332,2332,I was in a somewhat similar situation yesterday but mine went more smoothly I got an email that there was an error and to call a number then the lady said it was a System Error and asked for some more info from my ATampT account She then said it was all set and Id have in on or around the 11th,1,Negative

341,2341,Was the phone charged under your pillow or something Ive noticed if I charge electronics on my bed or under pillowblanket they can get warmer than usual The thing Ive noticed with those chargers even OEM ones is that the USB cable goes bad after 1 year or so You can tell by slower charges The adapter is usually fine but Ive had to replace a few USB cables,2,Neutral

349,2349,They go for 350 new so you could probably get away with 250 used if its in good condition,1,Negative
350,2350,Yeah online it shows up as 285 but if you go into the store right now during the sale you should be able to get it for around 260 including tax,2,Neutral

365,2365,Yeah going from a 6s to an s7 edge then to note 7 it wasnt amazingly different I think the only reason I would tell you to get the s7 edge is if you were inexperienced with android but you had it before so no point Plus I am sure it will have Android N on it which will make it better,1,Negative
366,2366,Aside from iris scanner 4k resolution and dual camera setup itll practically be the same as S7 with a slightly better 830 chipset its worth waiting if you arent in a rush for a phone but then again it might explode again,1,Negative

368,2368,This I was waiting for a phone that had been out for a month now i have to settle with a 6month old phone,1,Negative
369,2369,Thats what im thinking maybe its just high hopes but I expect it to be a loaded as possible phone and plenty of deals or incentives And for OPs other question Im sure Samsung would like to put it out earlier but that really depends on the suppliers and they definitely need to take their time and get this one right a rush job could easily end up in another disaster I would still expect it around Spring If your still fine with your phone I would definitely wait for the next round of true phone upgrades coming next year,1,Negative

377,2377,I really hope they at least do the sd card or the gear vr I plan to switch to the note 7 from my iPhone 6,3,Positive
378,2378,They may have something like that on their minds Too bad that in europe there is no new phones for replacement so im still without my new phone even though ive sent the defective one 12th of september and today is 21th but theres still no new info of whey they will send the devices They publicated the 19th of september as a start of exchange process but NOBODY in poland or germany got a new phone since then I have enough of these korean bastards im starting to think maybe north is the good side and the south is a bunch of thiefs I cant call them different since ive paid for a new device a lot and i dont have any just like thiefs do they steal your belongings so you dont have it Great customer service samsung CAT should have learned from you SARCASM CAT has replaced a phone with broken front glass even though it was broken by a phone user Now my boss have a good Cat S50 for no more costs than he spent when buying the device It lasted less than a week 2 way delivery and fixing the phone while the same service ccsonline pl is keeping my broken note 7 for over a week with no info on when they will send me new device If id screw that bad i wouldnt work in a company where i do work anymore Samsung is a joke of a company they promise 19th as a start of replacement exchange but its 21th today and NOBODY got new device in these 2 countries ive mentioned status as of 20th sep 10pm Today nothing has moved aswell so ill be without my new phone for more time I bet north korea would replace my phone faster than greedy korea the south one,1,Negative
379,2379,Arent we supposed to be getting 25 gift cards or something,2,Neutral
380,2380,I believe its only select stores right now as they have only supplied 500000 new Note 7s from what Ive read,1,Negative
381,2381,There is no money left for that This note 7 fiasco is going to kill their fiscal numbers Zero profits from cellular sales this quarter possibly the year,1,Negative
382,2382,In the apology I think the COO said they would take unprecedented steps to win customers back,1,Negative
383,2383,I bought the Note 4 on 9252014 the first day it was available Im not eligible for the Note 7 until 9252016So Ive been watching in amazement as everything had gone down Theyll have to offer some kind of promo to get new people buying again They wont want to itll cost a lot more money but as with the recall cost itll be a lot more expensive long term if they dont,1,Negative
384,2384,I was thinking the exact same thing I preorder a iPhone 7 while I love my Note I may end up permanently replacing it because I just dont see the resale value being there I swap phones annually and that is something thats important to me,1,Negative
385,2385,hmmm that is what they HAVE to do after selling an exploding phone,2,Neutral
386,2386,Giving US prioritiy instead of home state,2,Neutral
387,2387,Still its fuckin shitty that this issue even exists Samsung targeting sales over making a good working device Took mine back today and will have to wait until it gets sorted cause I dont trust itcant enjoy it anymore,1,Negative
388,2388,I purchased a Galaxy s5 when it first came out loved the phone the big screenand at that time I believe iPhone only had the regular small screen phones I switched over to the iPhone 6 Plus when I found out about the bigger screen Ive had it for 2 years now and I cant really complain about the phone Yeah you cant do much customization with it like you can with android but nowadays I really cant put in the time to customize it the way i want it When Samsung announced the Note 7 I did my research and was really impressed by it so I decided to switch back over to Android I preordered the phone and enjoyed the phone When I heard of the recall though I decided to return the Note 7 and get a refund I was a little put off by the recall I had concerns about the battery My phone would heat up after only using it for a few minutes Now I think I will wait and see what Apple comes out with tomorrow and decide between Samsung or Apple Im leaning more towards Apple though to be honest,1,Negative
389,2389,No but read the other comments here they are more reasonable because it doesnt assume the majority are tech enthusiasts like your post does All the things you listed are tech enthusiasts interests which wouldnt even show up in a infographic Any enthusiasts also knows iPhone 7s is the AMOLED Samsung is making them we are on a Samsung Subreddit btw display and would eye that instead of the mediocre upgrade coming tomorrow,1,Negative
390,2390,Before the recall there were people with iPhones that might have switched to the Note 7 if the iPhone 7 underwhelmed or got rid of the audio jack Now not so much,1,Negative
391,2391,People might switch because this makes Samsung look like it cant control the quality of their phones which is one thing that the public tends to believe Apple is very good at whether or not its true And for most people its either Samsung or Apple,1,Negative
392,2392,I think the reports of Apple buying more supplies after the note 7 bomb feature deployed is bogus I think supply chain gets ironed out well before the week of unveiling I think people who want note 7s will stay in the ecosystem of Samsung for their solution,1,Negative
393,2393,They cant replace it yet because there is no new version yet they either get an s7 as a replacement or wait for the new updated note 7,1,Negative
394,2394,It already has Id rather have all my fingers and no AUX port,1,Negative
395,2395,Not gon na lie its basically the same as the 6s If you want the Iphone 7 and already have the iphone 6s get the appleplug,1,Negative

399,2399,I think you will probably be fine the problematic battery account for less than 0 1 percent of the entire volume sold said the Samsung official,1,Negative
400,2400,I was literally looking all over for one today I dont know if the Verizon reps were really good actors or legitimately didnt know why they didnt have any but they all said they were on hold at the moment from Samsung one said they were expecting more on September 7 but that was probably a lie I assumed it was some weird form of false scarcity or something,1,Negative
401,2401,I read on the verge site that its going to be a worldwide recall on all Note 7s so does anyone have an idea of what is going to happen Im assuming its gon na go through the wireless companies Heres the link to The Verge article,1,Negative

419,2419,Oh wow i actually made a reddit account a few days ago to ask this same question unfortunately I cant make threads yet lol I actually purchased a S7 Edge which is also eligable for the promo at the very begining of the promotion from Samsung com I really wanted to get both at the same time and not wait and samsung would ship both together Actually best buy offered the promo but wouldnt honor it if you purchased an unlocked device Anyways when the phone shipped I was told the Gear Fit 2 was on back order The thing was when ever I checked the watch was never actually on back order like it was on back order for those of who took part in the promo Anyways I emailed them several times and didnt get anywhere and after three weeks I decided to post on samsungs facebook page My watch was sent out with 2 day shipping the next day I wasnt rude or anything just explained my frustration Err sorry if this is too lengthy this is my first reddit post Hope everyone gets there stuff soon,1,Negative

433,2433,Contact Samsung support on twitter by direct message a rep is currently helping me there My original issue was that the FedEx tracking said label created and the scheduled arrival date was yesterday However upon contacting FedEx and Samsung they say that the physical package wasnt picked up by FedEx yet So now theyre contacting FedEx again,1,Negative

439,2439,I got my Gear Fit 2 This is my 2nd day with it and I absolutely love it I know the 256GB Micro SD card would have probably been the better choice but I have never had a smart watch before and now I am very happy with my choice,4,Verypositive
440,2440,Im sure you googled it by now but if not,1,Negative
441,2441,Thats an invitation to the press conference usually the launch date is weeks later,2,Neutral
442,2442,Not likely This is the first piece of news about the s3 other than the IFA teaser Good thing I held off on getting the s2 with my note 7,1,Negative
443,2443,I think they wold need x86 from Intel and x64 from AMD AMD and Intel have a mutual agreement currently,2,Neutral
444,2444,Short answer no not anytime soon Someone will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that intel owns the x86 platform and allows AMD to make chip sets using that architecture they get something out of it cant remember what though So a few years ago there was rumors that Samsung was going to buy AMD and Intel gently reminded AMD that if they got bought they would no longer be able to use it or something along those lines and the deal fell apart So Samsung chugs along making their Exynos chip for the mobile market because android plays nicely I guess I heard that the chromebook they made with the Exynos processor was a pain because the chromium OS is x86 based,1,Negative
445,2445,Would need the x64 license from amd Intel doesnt own that patent However I agree I dont see samsung entering the pc market due to the advanced r and d for it as well as heavy market saturation,2,Neutral
446,2446,it wouldnt be for awhile but a lot of things could happen over time to change this Microsoft is developing Windows as a universal platform which no longer relies on X86 to compete with the ever growing popularity of Android and Ios and none of them need x86 It really just depends what defines a PC for you Both google and apple are working on multitasking to take their mobile OS to the next level to work as desktops with easy multitasking As for gaming you wouldnt get the massive backlog of Direct X games until someone figures out how to portemulate but if devs choose to use vulkan games could run on them,1,Negative
447,2447,Samsung is really focused on the mobile and embedded markets Thats where ARM architecture shines The simpler architecture cheaper license and lower powerheat management requirements just cant be beat They have experimented with Intel in a tablet the Tab 3 10 1 and it was underwhelming They do make laptops and desktop PCs in some markets but in the US its a very small part of their business ARM is used in their TVs Phones Watches and a variety of home appliances,1,Negative
448,2448,Samsung is great my wife tried Apple twice and is officially done with them Once we get our school checks we are hopping back to Samsung I will admit Samsung has dropped the ball a bit with doing things The S7 is a bounce back to the top for them Note 7 I am iffy with I am part of the phablet community of die hards Im just iffy with the battery The size needs to be complimented with the battery because there will be more demand on it Luckily I am getting it in September so I will have some time to hear from consumers and see how the phone plays out I am excited for the new features I just wish they added onto the old ones I dont mind a 12mp camera but please up the processor and RAM because those are advancing big now and they should have jumped on that when phones are going beyond that soon or already I hope they come out with a versionlike how Apple does the advanced versions of their iPhones and they do that stuff Phone isnt even out yet so no one really has an accurate idea on how its performing in the market,1,Negative
449,2449,You dont need to go Samsung ecosystem Just Android I owned iPhone since the 3GS this is my first SamsungAndroid phone and I went all in I have a Nvidia shield Huawei watch and a Samsung tablet I also have 2 gear s2s Samsung makes the best Android phone imo and the Galaxy is always going to be comparable to the iPhone Your really investing in the Android eco system and its great I still use a Windows computer and laptop though But it works fine with Android and now windows 10 will allow actionable notifications with Android phones Samsung does have a first party solution in side sync also which I use currently I like the gear s2 but my android wear is better imo,1,Negative
450,2450,I switched from iphone 6 to the s7 edge last week and Im loving it so far As mentioned already its more of switching to the android ecosystem rather than Samsung The good thing about android is that its flexible so if you wanted to continue to use icloud you can download a 3rd party app that lets you sync to it I genuinely dont miss a thing from apple anything and everything I could do on the iPhone I can do with the s7 edge And touchwiz really isnt a problem anymore,1,Negative
451,2451,Made my switch in April I dont have as much as you but I do have a macbook pro iPad you can still use probably Apple watch see ya Apple Tv not sure and macbook is fine just no iMessage Right now my only samsung product is the s7 edge soon to be Note 7 I am perfectly ok with that Maybe for Christmas I will get the Gear VR but other than that dont plan on getting a tablet or watch I love android since I switched I almost wish it did it earlier but glad I waited for the great phones Takes maybe a week or so to get use to it fully but I was surprised how similar android is to iOS Differences for sure but most things came natural to me pretty fast,1,Negative
452,2452,I actually just pre ordered the note 7 and am abandoning my iPhone 6 plus I feel like its worth it and am very excited Remember that samsung has that easy sync tool that you can use smart switch and I intend to use it thoroughly myself Good luck,3,Positive
453,2453,Thanks,2,Neutral
454,2454,I agree the whole Edge design is terrible It feels wierd and the glare sucks Its not novel its an inconvenience,1,Negative
455,2455,Such a great help My man,3,Positive
456,2456,Thanks man Appreciate it do you think I should wait for it or get the s7 edge tmorrow Is it worth the wait,1,Negative
457,2457,Holy that was helpful Nice insider You should consider posting it as a post,1,Negative
458,2458,Agree So many rumors and leaks If I owned a tech website Id leak some info too and draft up some concept or fake photos to get my website traffic up bring home a bigger paycheck Phones and other tech are no different than celebrity news all those tabloids make money so why wouldnt technology follow suit to get views,1,Negative
459,2459,Theyll stand behind it until someone wants to get their water damaged phone covered under warranty,2,Neutral
460,2460,Or their water damaged gear s2 replaced Im done tih samsung watches after the debacle,2,Neutral
461,2461,What the fuck is the big deal about that The curve will be even less than the s7 edge,1,Negative
462,2462,Personally I think it looks pretty damn nice Then again Im a huge fan of the way the S7 Edge looks,1,Negative
463,2463,This but with the lack of anything really new being rumored for the note7 I bet it will be disappointing,1,Negative
464,2464,Do you know the reason why Samsung doesnt just use the Exynos everywhere Is it a supply chain or a carrier thing maybe,1,Negative
465,2465,The screenshots are not faked and the results match because they picked them from the same page of the results list There are hundreds of i6700K tests with different results listed however And they are speculating that this is a new SD 830 or Samsung Exynos prototype not actually a current S7 Links Qualcomm SAMSUNGIntel Core i7 6700K,1,Negative
466,2466,I find it highly unlikely for it to actually happen Were moving kinda slowly and to be honest this is not possible We had rumors of the 8890 from Samsung managing to hit 3 4K on single core Yet here we are and it isnt hitting that so I highly doubt the next mobile chip is going to be this performing,0,Verynegative
467,2467,How did you disable it I dont have that option All I can do is force stop it but that wont prevent it from starting back up,2,Neutral
468,2468,The phone says fast wireless charging just like it says fast charging when its plugged in,1,Negative
469,2469,how did you get the samsung wireless charger for free,2,Neutral
470,2470,You can try the choetech branded ones on amazon I paid 20 for mine and it is fast charging Had it almost a year with no hiccups whatsoever,1,Negative
471,2471,whats the difference between the stand and the pad as the pad is more expensive,1,Negative

477,2477,Oh my God this still hasnt happened for you guys Im so sorry,1,Negative
478,2478,I have a wi fi issue similar but different with my S4 It doesnt take long to turn on I actually leave it on 99 of the time and I connect to my home wi fi without issue but I travel for work often and many hotels I stay in I have to reconnect on every visit usually the first time I connect it works fine but when i leave the hotel for work the next morning and I return that evening it wont reconnect most times or I have to do several phone reboots Its quite a a pain in the ass I only have 12 15 saved connections and its only the places i need to manually connect to each time I enter wi fi range where I have the issue Ive tried forgetting the connection canceling it during attempts turn wi fi off and on reboot the phone sometimes after 4 or 5 attempts at rebooting itll connect but its less than half the time it actually works Glad you figured your issue out though,0,Verynegative
479,2479,This exact same thing happened to me and am on the phone with them as I type this I have called about 5 times since the approval email to confirm I would be getting the Gear S2 and about the estimated ship date 418 However I received the VR and now that Im on the phone with a rep they said they cant speak to me because its under my wifes email All the other times I called it wasnt a issue but now that there is a mistake they cant speak to me without her saying its okay,1,Negative
480,2480,I agree this link is more up to date and informative than reddit,3,Positive
481,2481,Removed,2,Neutral
482,2482,My thoughts exactly My initial excitement tapered off when I saw the price,1,Negative
483,2483,I doubt it This is meant to be paired with Gear VR not just a phone Gear VR is only 99 This will cost a bit more than that at least 3x so theyre not gon na give it away for free via promo,1,Negative
484,2484,I use the Material Blue and Black theme,2,Neutral
485,2485,Same thing happens to me only with HBO At this point I just memorized what is where I have a material theme installed which makes the task bar darker but HBO is still white on white I guess Ill just have to wait for an update If you find a solution let me know,1,Negative
486,2486,Go install a Samsung Theme from the Theme store They have some really nice ones that will change the colors of the UI Or you could try Good Lock from the Galaxy App Store to also alter the look of notifications,1,Negative
487,2487,Yup only way It only asks once after a restart in general,1,Negative
488,2488,Is this the same promo that came out with the S6 I used an emulator last year to do the S6 promo and am not getting any new unlocks with my S7 Edge,2,Neutral
489,2489,In short its a turn based card game made by Blizzard,2,Neutral
490,2490,My TV is only 2 years old,2,Neutral
491,2491,Maybe it is just that Samsung doesnt care about the user experience or app ecosystem that much because they plan for users defaulting to AppleTV or similar products Meanwhile Samsung does care about revenue from selling your viewing patterns to advertisers which they can do whether or not you use the Smart TV If this is the way it is maybe the Smart TV OSSoftware is just really designed to make it hard for people who are not too concerned or too persistent about their privacy to find the well hidden opt out options You can hardly blame people for not taking the time to hunt down the opt out options with so many things going on with their TV DVD Players etc,1,Negative
492,2492,This is a lesson I learned the hard way I spent so much more for a Smart TV only to end up buying a Chromecast,1,Negative
493,2493,Yea that makes sense I have a Samsung smart TV but since I got a roku I never use the apps Roku is just easier for me to use,1,Negative
494,2494,Yet definitely not OTA,2,Neutral
495,2495,Is super quick a couple hours or like one hour from 0 100,2,Neutral
496,2496,This is the standard one that took almost 3 hours to charge the S6 Edge With the S7 Edge having even larger battery I would wait for a sale on the fast version of the wireless charger Shaved off about a hour of charge time on the faster one Should be a good bit faster for the newer devices too,1,Negative
497,2497,Thats the one I linked in my main post haha I agree it looks nice though,1,Negative

501,2501,Can you just hide or exclude the folder that the image is located in Not sure if the new stock gallery has that option Quickpic and other gallery apps do,1,Negative
502,2502,That actually makes sense I thought I was going crazy because no matter how many times I deleted it every time I opened my gallery it was back,1,Negative
503,2503,Yeah I think thats what it is Lol I feel so dumb I never noticed until right now that its the same logo as Pandora Unfortunately I looked on the app and still dont know how to get rid of it,1,Negative

507,2507,Stupid reasoning IMO Its a niche market and they will pay for it,1,Negative
508,2508,Im guessing no verizon yet,2,Neutral
509,2509,Mine has always stayed plugged in and its been like so for the past two months that I got it No issues whatsoever As far as putting it away from things I havent ran into issues to give me a reason to isolate it I just have it on my office desk next to my gear s2 wireless charger No issues of overheating or anything,1,Negative
510,2510,I used to leave it plugged in until it started creating this really high pitched noise So I plug it in to charge while sleeping and remove it when I wake up,1,Negative
511,2511,Its kind of a joke among people who know me to say that I will tell them to RTFM when they ask for help,2,Neutral
512,2512,If you want to use your phone like an iPhone the home menu being like an iPhone My S7E has this option to do it on So go to Settingsadvanced featuresgalaxy Labs and then show all apps on screen This will make your touch wiz homepage like an iOS homepage You dont need a launcher I dont know why people say touch wiz is really bad its fairly fast good to use If you dont like the colors you can apply themes from the theme store The one Im using right now is the Material Dark for the S7E although it might not be available for you but do look at other themes makes the phone even more beautiful,1,Negative
513,2513,Gon na try that Im gon na sound like such a noob but what exactly do the launchers do,1,Negative
514,2514,touchwiz is as good as ios What parallel universe do you live in,3,Positive
515,2515,Cool Ill try that Im just confused about all the different settings and features basically Just so accustomed to myou easy to use and navigate iPhones Im definitely already happy with my choice though just all the options are a bit overwhelming at first,1,Negative
516,2516,Go into the settings applications and disable anything that looks like its from your carrier Except Verizon sms if you dont want to and virtual voicemail or whatever ATampT and a few others have a lot of crap bloatware that will slow down your phone,1,Negative
517,2517,Good Lock from Galaxy App Store Nova Launcher Prime Two great places to start Check the options for both and customize ever hunting to just how you like it Can do icon packs etc with nova All kinds of gestures like swiping on an icon to open a folder etc,1,Negative
518,2518,Didnt even know about half the things yout mentioned Thanks a bunch,2,Neutral
519,2519,I would watch a youtube video on top tips for the S7 This is the quickest way to find out what the phone is capable of,1,Negative
520,2520,I would definitely watch a few how to and secrets videos about the gs7 edge Theyll help you get a general understanding of your phone Just remember with a galaxy if theres something you dont like about your phone theres probably a setting you can use to change it,2,Neutral
521,2521,I pre ordered mine last night from Samsung UKs website and it was delivered today during lunch,1,Negative
522,2522,Yeah it looks like Frontier comes with and without LTE They could have made this clearer,1,Negative
523,2523,People keep worrying about or hating on the size And it seems they always have because they used to hate on the original samsung watch which was smaller than this one I have always worn a casio gshock watch and have never had an issue with the size of any of these I wouldnt worry about it Big watches are in now anyways,1,Negative
524,2524,I like the fact that it looks like a normal watch,2,Neutral

529,2529,Im skeptical after the note 7 but intrigued,2,Neutral
530,2530,Everything Ive read says that every Frontier is LTE and every Classic is not,1,Negative
531,2531,yes,2,Neutral
532,2532,It looks really nice and masculine,3,Positive
533,2533,Both versions connect to the phone by Bluetooth Using the LTE functionality is optional,1,Negative
534,2534,Same especially if samsung has a promotion to get something for free with purchase,2,Neutral
535,2535,Maybe Im still pretty rattled about it though Terrible customer service,2,Neutral
536,2536,Another example of Crappy Samsung customer service Samsung is giving me more reasons every day to stop buying their product,1,Negative
537,2537,Canada BC Tom Harris Telus Wasnt given the service center never really crossed my mind to ask,2,Neutral
538,2538,Once I got it back I kinda realised that future of the phone wouldnt be a thing anymore Thanks for reminding me though,2,Neutral
539,2539,My thoughts exactly,2,Neutral
540,2540,Yeah I just dont really understand what they could have broken because I fixed it myself after Im actually typing on it right now Just threw a case on it to hide the back,1,Negative
541,2541,Not sure about that but I bought a case from Amazon and I asked and they gave me a full refund for the case and did not ask for it to be returned,1,Negative
542,2542,Depending on wherewho you purchased your device from you should definitely be reimbursed Source I work at a verizon retailer and we refund all note 7 accessories bought here,1,Negative
543,2543,When I read it it made it sound like you could only return stuff that you bought from that particular place And not like Amazon or anything,1,Negative
544,2544,No but that would be an interesting class action lawsuit,2,Neutral
545,2545,Im in the UK and the only communication Ive had from Samsung regarding all of was a txt from carphone warehouse saying that Samsung is recalling the phone,1,Negative
546,2546,Got the email today from samsung stating this Beginning Thursday October 13th Samsung Note7 owners can bring their device to the original Samsung or authorized reseller point of purchase to Exchange towards a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge device Receive a refund for the Note7 device and Note7 specific accessoriesSo yea they mention Note7 specific accessories I live in canada btw not sure if this applies everywhere else,1,Negative
547,2547,Ive done this as well for all accessories I bought,3,Positive
548,2548,I bought a funbag sleeve for my Note 7 on Amazon and as of now its a waste of 25 Its an import from Germany but the build quality is spectacular Hopefully my Edge will fight it in well enough for me to not want to send it back,3,Positive
549,2549,Amazon Italy refused refund and told me to fuck off since end period is 30 days not 40 On a sealedunused original Samsung leather case,1,Negative
550,2550,I messaged one of the places that sold me a note 7 case and they said the 30 day return period had passed Then I messaged Amazon and they made me start an a to z guarantee claim against the seller which they did for me I got my money back by the end of today,1,Negative
551,2551,Pretty sure being that they dont even show the phone on their website anymore Plus a lot of their accessories are being removed,2,Neutral
552,2552,hi everybody its interesting to know about Note 7 is this project has closed or Samsung try to reanimate it,2,Neutral
553,2553,Seems like an automated error Definitely keep what you have dont count on the note 7 to come back Even if it did I wouldnt waste my time again testing it out,0,Verynegative
554,2554,I have big hands and i use mine with one hand with no issues D but yeah if you dont have huge hands i guess that would be an issue,1,Negative
555,2555,Dawg this is why you try a phone before you buy it I love my edge,1,Negative
556,2556,c,2,Neutral
557,2557,Because that isnt what you think it is The edge panel is simply a quick access menu that you can drag icons to Disabling it only disables the menu and not the actual touch screen aspect of the edges,1,Negative
558,2558,The edges feel better when you have a case on the phone,3,Positive
559,2559,I dont have a problem i got used to it after a week getting bigger hands is your only option Its fixed on the N7 but its no longer an option,1,Negative
560,2560,They are fucking awful curved displays are a gimmick,1,Negative
561,2561,I am actually frustrated by the curved edge too Glad to know I am not alone,1,Negative
562,2562,Ive turned the Edge Panels completely off but as far as I know those are just the notification bars and dont actually turn the touch screen aspect off Do you know of any cases that maybe cover it up a bit,1,Negative
563,2563,I havent had any issues either but I have large hands My GF really wants the S7 Edge but Ive been trying to talk her out of it and go for the regular S7 Her hands are smaller so I believe she will have edge touching issues and she drops her phone a lot I just forsee a cracked screen in her future,1,Negative
564,2564,My case prevents accidental edge touching Ive handed it off to friends to look at something without issues I saw a coworker today with a cracked screen S7 edge with no case on it so I think its fair to assume you probably dont have a case on it for some reason If you want to use it 1 handed there are some cool cases with silicon ish finger loops that help My friend does that with his 6s he loves it and says it doesnt really bother him if its in his pocket and the loop helps navigate a giant phone with 1 hand,1,Negative
565,2565,This is what happens when a company cares more for a gimmick look instead of usability Yes the Edge looks cool but is not practical at all,2,Neutral
566,2566,I know Its so frustrating I can either have a hideous case on the phone or not be able to use it one handed What a shitty design,1,Negative
567,2567,Damn this is a bad bad bad experience What phone will you be switching to,1,Negative
568,2568,Get another phone in the meantime and bring it back with you in December When you get passed security have a ziploc bag already with you and then fill it with water and drop the phone in there for safety Then return for an exchange at T Mobile store,1,Negative
569,2569,and the fact that the airline would not allow me to bring it with me back to the US not even in checked luggage according to them There is no ban on flying with the phone you just cant power it up or charge it while on the plane There IS a specific ban against putting it in checked luggage though because there is always the worry that the phone will be jostled around and will be powered up unattended and then overheat inside your luggage,1,Negative
570,2570,P S that all sounds frustrating as fuck,1,Negative
571,2571,Apples idea if making it feel like a click is great this is what I think Samsung needs to copy a fourcetouch button,1,Negative
572,2572,If its good id be fine with it but itd be hard for it to be as good as the real thing,3,Positive
573,2573,I agree that having the screen extending to all 4 edges would be cool but you wouldnt have anywhere on the front of the device that you can hold and I bet there would be a hell of a lot of accidental touches Although this is coming from a guy who bought the edge variant so Id buy it anyway haha,1,Negative
574,2574,Dont forget reachability two light taps for iPhone three clicks for the Note Lotta functions to ask for from one button It would be nice to not have to depress the button with the Notes stylus however,2,Neutral
575,2575,I dont expect Samsung would have a sufficient tactile response like the iPhone 7 which is debatable if it is sufficient with a button Just having capacitive buttons I wouldnt mind but at that point Id prefer just having onscreen buttons,1,Negative
576,2576,I was skeptical at first but I bought the iphone 7 and the home button on it was really well done Kinda left me amazed actually I ended up returning the phone after 3 days because everything else was just meh and I hated the closed ecosystem but I miss that home button They managed to really simulate the feel of a click with haptic feedback So bottom line I would be all for this feature if similarly well executed replacing a physical home button on any and every phone its that well done,1,Negative
577,2577,Interesting take although ive never actually had a button wear out on me before,3,Positive
578,2578,I hate the plastic Ive had the S7 since launch and there are a few dents in the home button,1,Negative
579,2579,I wouldnt mind it I use the vibration feedback for the back and recents buttons whats one more,1,Negative
580,2580,either they make on screen button or physical home button non clicky button sucks,1,Negative
581,2581,I really like the physical home button I like physical buttons for a lot of things,1,Negative
582,2582,delete oculus home,1,Negative
583,2583,Am also having this issue only noticed it last night going to try removing oculus etc to see if it helps,1,Negative
584,2584,delete the gear vr app,1,Negative
585,2585,Oculus,2,Neutral
586,2586,yeah do it before this happens i work at a Sprint retailer and saw this,3,Positive
587,2587,uninstall oculus home,2,Neutral
588,2588,Mine is better as well,3,Positive
589,2589,Been on my phone all day and havent charged it at all now on 40 battery life is much better,1,Negative
590,2590,Ive noticed a significant change and Im not even at the rate of apps I had on the first version of the Note7,1,Negative
591,2591,that maybe the case this battery definitely feels like it pails in comparison to the original one,1,Negative
592,2592,Mine is worse Im using a Tmobile varient I just got it replaced 2 days ago on Saturday and spent all Sunday setting it up to be an exact clone as my old one in regards to apps which ones are on power saver settings and the layout Today was my first work day having the phone I work from 8 to 6 its in standby most of the day besides my breaks and a few sneak peeks at social media and stuff With my old phone I used to be able to be in the low 70 area by the time 6 00 rolls around Today at 6 my replacement phone was at 51,0,Verynegative
593,2593,I went from 100 20 in 9 hours including a lot of Pokemon Go n stuff,2,Neutral
594,2594,Nope getting about the same as before Having no trouble getting through a full day unless I decide to do 2 3 hours of 3D gaming,1,Negative
595,2595,wow thats good,3,Positive
596,2596,Wish we could trade in our previous smart watches,3,Positive
597,2597,I got the s2 classic for 100 bucks a few weeks ago at Verizon,3,Positive
598,2598,MST is hardware so the Gear S2 will never have MST unless they release an updated S2 It does have Samsung pay with NFC though,1,Negative
599,2599,no,1,Negative
600,2600,Price probably wont drop The s3 is an addition to the gear s line Its it replacing the gear s2,1,Negative
601,2601,Check on Swappa Ill probably list my classic up there when I get the new Gear S3,1,Negative
602,2602,I dont think itll drop permanently mostly cuz the Gear S3 i feel are just additional watches available to choose from just like when the Platinum and Rose Gold classics came out The S3 are bigger watches and so some people might not wan na buy it cuz they have smaller wrists Most likely itll just go on sale Source I work at Best Buy,1,Negative
603,2603,Since Samsung seems to be looking to sell the original S2 alongside the new range I wouldnt be surprised to see a price drop the same time pricing and availability for the S3 is announced I wouldnt expect a major RRP drop from Samsung though as they may not want it to seem too much of a bargain against the S3 but retailers may differ in strategy On a side note I was holding off getting the classic on contract with O2 UK in anticipation of new models and have noticed its no longer an option on their website Im hoping that means the S3 isnt too far away Although I would have quite happily gone with the classic knowing the new ones arent that much of a major upgrade Id hope Samsung would bring the software enhancements to the S2 Eventually,1,Negative
604,2604,My s6 is scratched to fuck and I only ever set it on my desk corning lies,1,Negative
605,2605,SPOILER most all glass scratches and can break,2,Neutral
606,2606,Youre missing the point I just want a second test to confirm or disprove the first one,1,Negative
607,2607,What impact The act of placing it in a cup holder What are you talking about,3,Positive
608,2608,I responded to this in another post I think Corning is wrong in their assessmentsee here,1,Negative
609,2609,It would be awesome to get some confirmation I hate how when you search for it it is just a million sites just repeating that video for gospel and no one giving a second test,1,Negative
610,2610,my has a scratch and I cant think how,2,Neutral
611,2611,Pretty stocked too,2,Neutral
612,2612,I have no idea i think the specs on the resolution are the same The difference is only on the size,2,Neutral
613,2613,Mines too My phone is coming from Texas and its saying Im going to get it on the 22nd Damn,1,Negative

616,2616,Well that sucks I was told they were being released on the same day at Verizon,1,Negative
617,2617,I am coming from a note 3 iPhone 5 and 6 then note 5 Love the s pen and outside of that the phones are identical except to me the note 7 looks more attractive,1,Negative
618,2618,I think the 19th is the street date Im pretty sure they arent allowed to deliver them prior to when the brick and mortar stores are allowed to sell them,1,Negative
619,2619,I read if you pre order you get it 3 days early,2,Neutral
620,2620,Looks like a bunch of people are seeing movement over on rtmobile as of about an hour and a half,2,Neutral
621,2621,Lucky Wish mine would ship faster,2,Neutral
622,2622,Mine too Fedex next day,1,Negative
623,2623,I just ordered and was told theyre being overnighted,1,Negative
624,2624,Didnt this sites owner get hired by Apple The sites founder left to work for Apple and sold off the site so theres no conflict of interest He has no remaining involvement and newer employees like myself have never even met him Are there any specific aspects of the review you find unfair that justify your assessment of the review as biased,1,Negative
625,2625,Eh I take it for what it is This one reviewers take was good to middling You cant please everyone If good is the worst review I have read today that is alright with me Most of the other reviews have been overwhelmingly positive,2,Neutral
626,2626,Normally Im not one for all the fluff but Im there to see the benchmarks on things since they do a good job on that note The opinionated bit did irk me though,1,Negative
627,2627,Praise for the HTC 10 is probably from the fact that the author is in the middle of reviewing that device and had to drop what he was doing to push out a Note 7 review before going back to it Might just be what he compares it to since that is the other device he is most recently working with,1,Negative
628,2628,The CNET review on 5 reasons not to buy the Note 7 was trash Those were horrible reasons,1,Negative
629,2629,Sorry not sure from legal perspective But its Samsung brand store as said on www samsung com about my shop It sells only samsung devices and there is no any different brand or label on this shop except Samsung,1,Negative
630,2630,I did contact Samsung service desk But they reject to help in my case because they responsible only in case of repair,1,Negative
631,2631,No way I got a mate who just brought this camera AND his brother has a 3D printerNO WAY this guys called Henry too what a coincidence Oh,2,Neutral
632,2632,I too have a 6S Plus and Im about to switch back Im torn on either getting the S7e or the Note 7 I was going to wait on the Note 7 but the way the specs are laying out I may just go with the 7 edge,1,Negative
633,2633,Good move You wont regret it Stop being so limited by apple ooops,3,Positive
634,2634,Why switch I switched from the 5s to a lg g3 because the audio book support on the iPhone was fantastically shitty A few things to consider before switching iPhones hold there value way longer Apple seamlessly syncs your stuff Android does it but its a bit of work to set up Google play and iTunes for audio are way different and much like the syncing its going to take some work for it work like iTunes IOS is less laggy all around G3 to 5s was rough S7 edge to iPhone 6 not as much difference but noticeable edit Nothing like giving out advice to get downvoted,1,Negative
635,2635,The Google Play Store will have just about any app youre looking for Its pretty straightforward apps in categories and there are plenty of options for anything you might be trying to do As far as rooting goes the Android equivalent to jailbreak it means you and apps you specify have root access meaning if you wanted you could delete your system folder and watch the phone die but its super easy to restoreinstall ROMs on most Samsung phones as easy as flashing a ZIP file from your SD card and if I recall correctly the ATampT and T Mobile versions are rootable thanks to a leaked developer bootloader or something However its been a few weeks since Ive looked into any of that as all my attention has been on the unannounced Galaxy Note7,1,Negative
636,2636,I made the switch from my iPhone 5s to s7 edge at the beginning of the month And Im glad I did The display is so nice Camera is amazing as well Its a sleek looking phone too I havent changed much on the phone I think its good as it is But there is so much you can do I like the info Google provides to you and learning the system was easy Moving my music over was easy enough too The only thing I miss is imessage And its really not a big deal because all my friends use WhatsApp I think Samsung makes a nice phone and I would do it again,3,Positive
637,2637,Thats a good point Thanks for the suggestion,3,Positive
638,2638,Im not thrilled about the note being offered in the edge variety,1,Negative
639,2639,Are you going to keep the screen naked now or try a film protector,2,Neutral
640,2640,Really was I jumped on the S7E even though it appeared it would never be rooted And to be quite honest I thought it wouldnt be but here we are Those guys did awesome work,1,Negative
641,2641,The glance option is really cool,3,Positive
642,2642,I wonder how the performane is,2,Neutral
643,2643,These are baby steps towards a non Google phone Mark my words,2,Neutral
644,2644,This is on the Note5 Title is misleading,1,Negative
645,2645,The search bar in the notification shade is pretty cool This is actually the first feasible way of replacing the app drawer I have seen,3,Positive
646,2646,Thanks hopefully thats better than my fitbits sleep tracker I didnt get much use out of that one although I was really hoping to like it,1,Negative
647,2647,Ive been using S Health with it The GPS tracker seemed to work pretty accurately during a hike where I left my phone in the car I wasnt sure if itd still track or not but it sure did GPS mapping elevation heart rate steps etc The Gear S2 is pretty awesome I had all intentions of selling it when it came in but I couldnt resist opening the package to play with it for a bit After downloading a bunch of watch faces and customizing it a bit Im hooked People are surprised how clear the calls are too Its nice for the quick reply txts when Im busy,1,Negative
648,2648,You had to pre order the phone and register for the promotion back in March,2,Neutral
649,2649,I just got mine yesterday and Ive been fiddling around with it Trying to get used to milk music app,1,Negative
650,2650,I recommend the app Toggles Widget It allows you to change your phone settings such as WiFi silentvibrate mode NFC Bluetooth etc Add it to your widget screen and itll allow for easy access to silent your phone quickly before a meeting for example It costs two bucks but is well worth it in my opinion It shouldve been a standard feature on the watch Casia is an elegant watch face that offers a lot of nice features for free My current watch face which costs a dollar is the Fusion Watch Face which I think is very sleek and nice looking Try turning on your always on display if youd like Itll impact your battery slightly but I still end everyday with about 30 to 40 left so its not bad at all,3,Positive
651,2651,Ill definitely get a lot of use out the S Health app I like the one on the phone good enough but I think itll be more accurate with the watch And thanks for the warning about the notifications,2,Neutral
652,2652,Source,2,Neutral
653,2653,You can really see how the Huawei captures better pictures in very dark places You can also notice that dark areas in bright images are brighter than the GS7,2,Neutral
654,2654,I think that the final results are very similar Where one phone has a white haze on a photo other phone has it on a different one Where Huawei excels and not only with P9 are night photos they know very well how to work with street light I tend towards the P9 being slightly better but when they anncouned the dual camera I expected the results to be better than this,1,Negative
655,2655,I prefer the s7 except for that parking lot picture towards the beginning,2,Neutral
656,2656,It looks like he has finger grease on the lens on some of those night shots,1,Negative
657,2657,Seems like the S7 has a white haze on each photo,1,Negative
658,2658,Jeez what happened Maybe get something thin and put super glue on the end to pull it out,1,Negative
659,2659,Take it to Best Buy,3,Positive
660,2660,Ive seen this happen before The clicking mechanism on the pen is stuck all the way in What I did was got some double sticky tape and worked it out with that,1,Negative
661,2661,This isnt the first time its gotten stuck in there the pop up end sticks on my s pen but normally I can just pop it out by catching an edge with my pocket knife Today though it seems to have pushed deeper into my phone somehow Its about 2 3mm deep I cant get so much as a safety pin into it Any ideas The phone works fine still but I quite like having the pen available to me,1,Negative
662,2662,its immersive a pity about the screendoor effect though,1,Negative
663,2663,Thank you ordering right now i was scared about that huge blakc border from screen captures on youtube but i guess theres no way to actually recreate what it feels like to wear it realistically,1,Negative
664,2664,When I tried it I was more into 360 pictures under the ocean than I was the Cirque Du Soleil demo I couldnt get into the controls in the brief time I had it on I could definitely see myself watching movies though and trying some games,1,Negative
665,2665,I wouldnt count on the Samsung store getting it to you any faster I have been waiting for a micro SD card from them that was and still is listed as in stock for nearly a month Their online store has terrible customer service literally zero help it makes no sense since they are so big,1,Negative

668,2668,I emailed support about a week ago about never having the option to get the smart watch instead of the VR and still havent gotten a reply,2,Neutral
669,2669,I have no idea how long until they send the 100 coupon but I do know it will get here before the gear VR would have,1,Negative
670,2670,I think the dial is good and it was nice to find new music They came a bit late and now the market for streaming music is saturated Pandora Spotify Google amp Apple music have already made their names and Id rather they just fold into another service than drag it out,2,Neutral

684,2684,I got an Otterbox Symmetry for my edge it really surprised me how low profile and sleek it is and how much protection it adds to the phone I got mine from Bell only because I didnt want to wait for shipping and risk dropping my phone while waiting for the case,1,Negative

694,2694,What are the other reasons for returning And what are you switching to,2,Neutral
695,2695,Hmmm I hadnt noticed this before it does respond to the activation phrase while on a charger Unfortunately for me I use a secure lock screen required if you use a VPN or if you want to be able to use Samsung Pay which are both true for me and although I do get the Google Now listening dialog it forces me to unlock the screen before processing my command Kind of defeats the purpose of an always listening mode,1,Negative

724,2724,Ran out of watches Thats to be expected So its between a microsd card and a gearvr Better value is probably the micro SD card When they get enough inventory again and work through the recalled units Id expect a similar or better promo After all they cant afford not to sell units theyre already spending 1B on the recall so they might as well put 10 30M into a post recall discount promo campaign so new customers buy a Note 7 or are interested in an S8 Without continued momentum beyond the recall major market share is in jeopardy Which is why they spent 1B on the recall immediate They cant afford not to,1,Negative

797,2797,Everyone has some good battery life except for me on the S7 Snapchat is such a drain,1,Negative
798,2798,I appreciate the effort but this is 100 useless without the screen on time Also wifi only is much better for the battery so Im really unable to take anything away from this Try again tomorrow with the SOT,1,Negative

800,2800,im thinking s7 edge from my note 5 I rarely use my stylus,1,Negative
801,2801,Ive had the s6 edge for a year It looks far superior That being said its a pain in the ass to pickup and text in one hand Maybe I have inordinately inbred small hands I much prefer the look of the s7 edge but with the extra size I can see me throwing it all over the place constantly If the silver version was available in the UK Id take that and swallow the annoyingness of constantly dropping it but seeing as its black or gold I pre ordered the standard s7 and the more I look at it the better a choice it is looking Im hoping the looks are a grower,1,Negative
802,2802,So you want a note without a stylus,2,Neutral
803,2803,Im getting edge for the possibility of using such a large phone one handed most of the time thanks to the edge panel I have small hands and my 4 7 phone is too big now and pretty much all flagship phones on offer are bigger than that so Im looking to the edge display to put things in reach Plus I liked the edge in the s6 so Im finally giving in,1,Negative
804,2804,I am happy with my decision and Im loving the s7 edge The iPhone SE was not what I was looking for and hopefully the iPhone 7 coming in fall 2016 will appeal to me the same as the SE,1,Negative

807,2807,Not OP but I am moving from the IPhone 6 to GS7 Edge Its got the speed camera quality looks and hopefully battery life Im looking for The Edge may not be that useful from a practicality standpoint but it is undeniably cool and gives a different look then every plain slab of glass Im holding out hope for a multitask edge mode similar to the apps edge but with dynamic timelocation based or with open apps populating it,1,Negative

811,2811,I have the Galaxy Note 5 and Ill be trading it in for the S7 Its cause I prefer having a smaller phone The SPen is nice but I dont really need it Plus expandable storage is something I needed more than I thought My first phone was an S3 which lasted almost 4 years,1,Negative
812,2812,I preordered the s7 edge simply because Im bored with current devices and want something different,1,Negative
813,2813,I went into best buy today with the mindset that I would definitely pre order the S7 Edge After i played around with them both i changed my mind and i pre ordered the regular S7 The big phone with the curved screen felt awkward in my hand and the side swiping didnt work as well as I expected it would and I cant think of when Id ever use it to be honest Im glad I went in to check them out in person and I recommend anyone considering pre ordering to do the same Both phones have the same camera and its AMAZING Puts my LG G4 camera to shame in a side by side test actually or maybe the photos just look a lot better on the improved screen of the Samsung On a side note the Samsung Gear VR is pretty neat I get it free with a current t mobile promotion Its probably one of those things I use a lot at first and never touch again but oh well,1,Negative
814,2814,I like the S7 better than the Edge edge features are useless for me and still feel gimmick Only reason I will pick the edge is because of 3600 mah battery over 3000 with the S7,1,Negative
815,2815,Ill wait for the Note 6,2,Neutral
816,2816,If the edge had more ram or better processor I would Bigger battery edge screen simply isnt worth it to me Ill be getting the s7,1,Negative
817,2817,Planning on getting the S7 to replace my N5 Biggest draw to the S7 is wireless charging and expandable memory I kept going back and forth between the 7 and the 7 edge but i dont really have a use for the edge extras and i kinda like the 5 ish inch size phones i dont have a need for a larger phone so yeah,1,Negative
818,2818,I pre ordered the S7 I think it just fits better in my hands than the S7 edge The edge looks better especially the silver one omg but for everyday use I think Ill get annoyed of the size,1,Negative

838,2838,Its possible you may have installed something that had adware built in The easiest way to remove it is to do a factory reset It clears everything from your phone and it goes back to a state as If your phone is brand new so before you factory reset it look through the settings and find an option that says backup and reset save everything that is important to you either on a cloud storage or to your computer,1,Negative
