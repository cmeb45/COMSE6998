1,1,Oh to be stupid and smug,1,Negative
2,2,From what Ive seen it can happen at any moment Its caused by heat being fed too much power while charging as a result of bad power regulator design Basically the battery Samsung ordered from their supplier shouldnt be exploding under the heat it gets But the power regulator in the phone is failing causing the excess heat in the first place So the batteries would be 100 fine if samsung didnt fail on their end TLDR Dont charge it in your car with AC off in summer Dont charge it on your bed or any cloth Dont charge it in a hot kitchen Dont charge it anywhere that can cause it to retain heat,2,Neutral

72,72,I just called Samsung uk to tell them this not in those words exactly but since our alternative solutions to the note 7 problem are just to get a refund and a new contract I asked if theres any way an actual solution like this could happen After some talking and being left on hold while she discussed with a manager she genuinely I hope made a note on my account and said to wait for a call back It might be that they are not aware that this sort of solution would help to make the situation better for note 7 users Id advise everyone in this situation call Samsung and let them know this option of getting a replacement s7 phone and an automatic upgrade when a new model is released would convince you to stay with Samsung and return your note 7 It might at least help to make this a reality,0,Verynegative

100,100,I was wondering what was the time frame we had to exchange our phones Like theoretically use the free exchange as some sort of insurance policy Hold on to your original Note 7 until the very last day of the turn in period so just in case your phone should break in one way or another during that time frame you would basically get a new one for free,1,Negative
101,101,what,2,Neutral
102,102,He dropped it like its hot,3,Positive
103,103,Took it off to see how much I liked a caseless phone since like I said they take it back in any condition This phone is so sleek it slides out of pockets way too easily for me haha I have a case waiting on the new one,1,Negative

105,105,Im in the same boat as you and share a similar sentiment but regardless of the datedness of the S5 at this point lets be real that thing is a tank Ugly but definitely a tank,1,Negative
106,106,Probably from all the smoke,2,Neutral
107,107,If anything like that would happen it will be the S7S7 Edge They no longer manufacture the Note 5 and likely dont have enough in supply There are reports they are ramping up production on the S7S7 edge though so it may be the case,1,Negative
108,108,The S7 is seven months old and its out dated,1,Negative
109,109,I have to admit I am extremely disappointed to see Samsung tank this hard on a flagship I currently carry the S7 Edge which I LOVE but I was looking forward to upgrading to the Note 7 The bigger screen was really appealing as was the functionality of the edge without the drastic bevel,1,Negative
110,110,are you me Seriously though same exact situation I switched from the Note 3 to the pre ordered 7 decided to splurge and get the accessories came with the Gear Fit bought a wireless charging pad and Gear VR It truly is everything I want in a phone and it works with the accessories so well Now Im trying to figure out what to do,1,Negative
111,111,Note 5 isnt terrible The exynos is still no slouch even though its outdated,1,Negative
112,112,I also had a Note 7 2 months after I bought a OnePlus 3 enjoyed it for about 2 weeks and loved the sh out of it before the explosion reports Unfortunately not even the Pixel XL can compare You wont find features such as water resistance s pen and dual sim on the Pixel XL The Pixel hardware is nice but Googles default android software is so basic The Note 7 had so many features bloat added by Samsung that I really liked I am now back to using my OnePlus 3 and I dont know what to get The only thing standing between me and a Pixel or even a HTC 10 is the dual sim feature,1,Negative
113,113,March s8 ez,2,Neutral
114,114,Compared to the note 7 you have no idea Its very outdated,1,Negative
115,115,I share your sentiments exactly Nothing out there is as good as the note 7 was so Im just going to hold onto my s6 edge If the S8 impresses me Ill probably buy one of those although I will miss the S pen Its just a waiting game now,1,Negative
116,116,I agree with you Although I have a note 5 which Im surprised to say Im decently content with I finally got the wife to upgrade from her s4 and shes absolutely gutted she wants her note 7 back in a bad way and the s7 edge doesnt really cut it So Im in the same place might end up giving the kids an s7 edge when theres a note 7 replacement,1,Negative
117,117,Why not be constructive instead,1,Negative
118,118,Im definitely keeping the phone Except if they officially recall it Then the TSA could seize it at a port of entry So you know,2,Neutral
119,119,I would call it the Ford Pinto of phones,2,Neutral
120,120,My theory with the note 7 and apple 7 is that the phones have no way to cool down since theyre so air tight in order to be water proof maybe thats helping things overheat to the point that they just start to fail and poof Man Anyone know when the LG v20 is coming out,1,Negative
121,121,Same here Everything about the 7 is so much better than the note 4 Im absolutely gutted,1,Negative
122,122,Even with two recalls Id argue the note 7 to still be the best phone released this year Easy,3,Positive
123,123,Its more a matter of Samsung bricking the device at this point In my line of work when entering oil terminals they ask to see if I have a Samsung phone regardless of what version it is Youre better off biting the bullet and downgrading although its just an upgrade because youll actually be allowed to travel with your phone,1,Negative
124,124,Is there a deadline to receive refunds for the Note 7 I feel like I want to keep it until at least Spring when the new generation of phones come out,1,Negative
125,125,Im back on my Note 3 too and mourning the loss of my stupid sexy Note 7 My colleague has an S7 Edge that Ive been fondling and its close enough to the Note 7 that Ill temporarily upgrade to one After that Ill get whatever the next stylus phone is that Samsung releases later next year,1,Negative
126,126,Im able to return it for a 100 refund I had the Note 2 and Note 3 for years with no issue The only harm I have had from this is the frustration of having to return the phone twice Im sure that in two years they will have either fixed their issues or completely imploded Knowing Samsung as a company I will bet that they will have fixed their issues If you dont feel confident in them to purchase a Samsung product again I completely understand but I have found that outside of this incident their quality has been unsurpassed Then again maybe the Pixel will win me over,2,Neutral
127,127,I also gave up my Note 7 today I recommend the S7 Edge in an upgrade program like T mobile Jump On Demand,1,Negative
128,128,I bet Apple Sabotage the batteries Now theyre laughing all the way to the bank,2,Neutral
129,129,I could have ended up with one of these phones if they released a flat version its super lucky they insisted on the damn curved screen or Id be an owner,1,Negative

136,136,And its a good thing I have an extra phone that I didnt get rid of,3,Positive
137,137,Yeah this is the thing Im thinking exactly the same now Fuck Although OPs answers are pretty vague so its difficult to tell what the actual situation was if theres any chance that it was not plugged in not charging not fresh off a charge and it just randomly exploded in his hand Then it is a much bigger more scary situation than i had been led to believe,1,Negative
138,138,Any more Info or a source on that,2,Neutral
139,139,Im not entirely sure but Id put my money on before any official statement by Samsung,1,Negative
140,140,If you know your phone has a chance of over heating and exploding and you still want to use it before recall then common sense says dont put a case on it,1,Negative

154,154,If its not a note 7 its been tampered with I guarantee it,1,Negative
155,155,If its confirmed that its a stock battery its almost worse though because it shows theyre having issues with more than one model of phone Its very likely it was a 3rd party battery though,1,Negative
156,156,What was the other one,2,Neutral
157,157,Non insurance repair involves replacing the deviceAre you sure about this My friend cracked his S7 Edge a few months back and Samsung replaced the screen on his device and gave him back the exact same phone he already had,2,Neutral

159,159,WTF This is a new low even for Samsung customer service What a total fiasco this company You would think they would do all they could to help their current and loyal customers,1,Negative
160,160,When I pressed them they wouldnt give me a time frame And you think the Note7 fiasco will be over in a few weeks How long is reasonable for me to wait with a broken phone,1,Negative
161,161,Screen breakage isnt covered under warranty so 0 months,1,Negative
162,162,When they repaired my S7E they indicated that the screen and bezel edge frame is one unit Not only that but the screen is fully curved at the sides unlike any other phone that i know of which carries its own premium in labor and the manufacturing process used to make it,1,Negative
163,163,They must be real careless Dropped my S6E a few times already once even from about 1 2m above the ground No cracks at all only minor dents around the aluminium edges thats hardly noticeable I dont have a case or screen protector but either way you got to learn how to grip and take care of your phone Like if I am bringing my phone along for running I make damn well sure that my pants pocket is deep and not shallow otherwise the phone can drop out of the pocket easily,1,Negative
164,164,S7E is gon na be about 350 400 bucks as somebody in the repair industry unless theyre using knock off non OEM parts Also you guys should change up your procedure for Water Damaged phones I have gotten 4 people coming to me after taking it to you guys first because apparently all you do is put it in a humid controlled heat box for a given amount of time o o,1,Negative
165,165,exactly hopefully this really will be a temporary situation I suspect that they dont actually fix your phone they just replace it with a new one and recycle the components from the old phone into a refurbished one and maybe they are low on S7e with the Note7 mess I dont know I just cant believe theyd take this approach its like they want their stock to crash even further,0,Verynegative

182,182,Pretty crazy to see it go already I wasnt looking to get a Note 7 myself but do have a friend who upgraded from a Note 4 Not sure what his next move is I know for me Im still hoping for the Note 8 I think the only thing they can do now is taking their time and make sure whatever theyre coming up with next does not have the same faults as the Note 7 I think loyalists will be fine waiting an extra month or some than usual if it means making sure what we buy isnt exploding on us I still could see some dumb pranksters trying to keep Samsung looking bad in the future though,1,Negative

190,190,I get your mad but you are very ignorant Comparing samsung to Islamic terrorists is retarded Calling them any sort of terrorist shows you have no idea what that word means and are just saying crap Yes they rushed the phone but that wasnt the issue The issue wasnt testing the issue was that one factory fucked up the fail safes for the battery on a very small number of phones Samsung understanding the severity of the situation issued a recall and several warnings I dont know what happened with the replacement phones I dont know why some of them exploded But samsung didnt plan on it happening At least they did the smart thing and discontinued it The phones image was ruined Nothing could bring it back,1,Negative

204,204,Same I personally think the more rounded corners of the S7 edge better fit the Samsung theme as well,3,Positive
205,205,Looks like the S7 has a pink tinted AMOLED,1,Negative

253,253,There are a lot of other phones with built in batteries which are just fine,1,Negative
254,254,Yes Samsung will be fine But I dont know about their smartphone division This could really hurt them big time Everytime someone flies goes on a train ect they will hear Note7 dangerous for the next year I could easily see the Galaxy brand be permenantly hurt At that point Samsung may decide to put less emphasis and investment in the mobile division and concentrate on their chip fab Samsung may be on the same level as Sony HTC Moto ect and no longer the clear cut 1 Android brand They already lost their crown in China and this will probably lose their crown to Google in the USA,1,Negative

270,270,Im giving the iris scanner a break with it being new Usually those things get pretty buffed out in updates and when new models come out The fingerprint I would expect to be faster and of course when you have muscle memory to just do it from older phones I think once you get used to using the scanner it will be more efficient Like your muscle memory will position it right after a while and you will get used to swiping to unlock that you wont notice it as you do now with how you are just starting to use it I assume in the next models they will have a more efficient way or even with updates that will make the iris scanner faster to use than to swipe the screen I think the biggest use of it is being the security behind it I heard scanning eyes is much harder to work around than fi ngerprints for hackers,1,Negative

330,330,After my second note 7 I decided to switch to the 7 edge and if Im being honest I actually wish I got the edge to begin with Its a work of art and the perfect size and while I miss the s pen I find the edge so much more comfortable to hold and use I may switch to a pixel xl if they end up coming to ATampT but we shall see,1,Negative

379,379,If you want more of a Vanilla feel to your Samsung device download Nova Launcher and Good Lock Having owned every Nexus phone except the 6p the S7 edge is the best phone I have ever owned Tried Sony HTC LG UMI Just picked up a used Note 5 and kind of liking that also Welcome to Android where everyone hates Samsung,1,Negative
380,380,That really depends on what you are looking for in the phone If you like Samsungtouchwiz features such as pop up Windows Samsung pay wireless charging and many others plus you want a micro sd card slot then Samsung phones are better But if you prefer the stock Android feel more timely updates less noticeable lag then the pixel is better It really more preference than which is better,1,Negative

446,446,All the fanboys in the other threads defending Samsung knew nothing of corporate culture It will be interesting to see how much of a hole Samsung digs itself into,1,Negative
447,447,This isnt the first time theyve showed that they give little fucks about their customers People fangirl over new devices but forget that 1 year later those same phones are going without software updates and running old android versions Look at least years Galaxy S 6s Only just got Android 6 AFTER Android 7 came out Samsung is an awful company,1,Negative

455,455,Uh oh If they take away microSD even with a 256GB option,1,Negative
456,456,Would welcome this greatly I think they need the spec for Chinese market and just to tout they have a 256gb variant like the iPhone Id be happy with 64 or 128 plus micro SD Cant see them returning to no SD card after the s6 debacle and the sheer popularity of the s7 line,2,Neutral
457,457,it just depends on the price IMO Sometimes the price bumps for extra storage arent so outrageous and then there is Apple who is 100 for every tier Im big on SD cards myself and dont really want a phone without one if i can help it but I would pay extra for more superfast storage in addition to SD cards if its reasonable and not a gouge It would be nice to see if the S8 gets a basic storage capacity jump since iphone 7 has 32GB now,0,Verynegative

486,486,Fire sale,2,Neutral
487,487,Same Even after the recall I was excited to purchase a Note 7 If this turns out to be true then I feel morally obligated to not give Samsung any of my money for screwing up this bad,1,Negative
488,488,Alright you asked for it This is the real low light comparison S6 top S7 bottom,1,Negative
489,489,except its not the exposure lock was clearly taken in two different spots resulting in a different exposure where the S6 has blown out the highlights the only way this experiment would have been fair was to set the camera in manual mode and match the values between the two phones,1,Negative
490,490,you are correct its clearly a different exposure,2,Neutral
491,491,this isnt really a comparison of anything other than exposure,2,Neutral
492,492,as I said in a different comment please repeat the test by putting the camera on manual and match the values between the two phones or you might get different exposures like in the photo you did,2,Neutral
493,493,I got ta say one thing The glass over my note 5 and s6 are terrible at getting oil on them Every time I go to take a picture I have to wipe off the glass or itll look like the photo here What Im getting at is o think the s6 had an oily film over the glass when this was taken because thats how mine looks when it has oil on it,1,Negative
494,494,I got mine today Holy crap the camera is amazing in low light and its crispy af outside,1,Negative
495,495,I heard that exposure was different on the two phones The first shots was everything on the default settings This shot is where the exposure has been set to the lowest S7 top S6 bottom,2,Neutral
496,496,To be honest stereo speakers are not on my list to improve Got a s6 and while I would like an improvement on that one speaker stereo isnt a big deal I only use it for YouTube or other short video for music I use ear plugs wired or bt speakers If they can fit descent stereo speakers without removing anything sure why not but I wouldnt want to swap anything present right now for them,1,Negative
497,497,Samsung wont add those because theyre useless Who cares about that kind of speakers when you have a audio jack or Bluetooth speekers Besides who the hell listens to music directly from the phones,1,Negative
498,498,How are stereo speakers that are 18 big and an inch apart any kind of improvement If one wants stereo from a phone youre using headphones anyway,1,Negative
499,499,Theyve listened to consumers for the last few years They brought back micro SD card support water resistance they made the phone thicker for a bigger battery and slimmed down TouchWiz As long as they continue to listen to consumers and think rationally I think theyll keep the headphone jack,1,Negative
500,500,I just hope they use Samsung processors instead of Qualcomm for every model like the s6,2,Neutral
501,501,Yeah if theyre going to improve audio quality Id rather they do it in a way that actually makes a difference I e DAC Phone speakers are going to sound like absolute tinny garbage even if there are two of them,1,Negative
502,502,My S8 hopes 1 Dont be afraid to make it slightly thicker for a larger battery Seriously if companies like Xiaomi can have a 4050mAh battery for their own Note phones that cost much less Samsung should go all out No one buys phone X because its 0 7mm thinner than phone Y 2 More reduction of bloatware I cant stand redundant apps like Camera amp Magnifier For other apps that hardly people ever use like S Health or Samsung Gear DO NOT pre install them If they need apps to sync with other devices like the Samsung smartwatch let them download them upon syncing rather than pre installing them 3 One up Apple further by setting a default 64GB storage 4 The default apps amp settings visuals should take more cue from the Black Theme darker colors so less battery life is being consumed Sure consumers can manually change to the all black theme but the average general public are somewhat too dumb for that I have a handful of relativesfriends who dont know about this5 Yes dual cameras nuff said 6 4GB RAM and disable the loading animations You can manually do them in Developer Mode but again how much do the general public know Of course all that and VR performance and non exploding batteries would be enough to knock Apple of its spot,1,Negative
503,503,apple is garbagio mang,2,Neutral
504,504,Im going to be so disappointed in Samsung if they remove the headphone jack If thats the case I would just keep my s7,1,Negative
505,505,stereo speakers plz no i will literally never use it,1,Negative
506,506,They should work on keeping the phone from exploding and catching fire before worrying about speakers haha,2,Neutral
507,507,As far as Im concerned Samsungs brand has been permanently tarnished and I will not be buying a Samsung phone for the foreseeable future Their handling of this disaster has been breathtakingly callous and stupid,1,Negative
508,508,That dude that breathed all that black smoke might get cancer and die decades earlier than he should Hope he gets MILLIONS from Samsung Look all companies make mistakes But making the same mistake that can cost peoples lives is almost unforgivable,1,Negative
509,509,Cheap ass phones,2,Neutral
510,510,In the same boat here Already gotten a few people Ive run into make comments like sure it wont explode etc the s7 appears to be tarnished where I live because of this as well It doesnt matter if you tell them its a different line of phone To many people I meet Samsung now equals boom,1,Negative
511,511,Well the device has to be on in order for current to flow an the issue is something in the phone is heating up too much and causes failure I assume theres too much current being drawn by the part that fails and either the battery cant handle it or the part gets so hot the battery fails and erupts,1,Negative
512,512,Probably will be permanent Theres no 3 strike rule here I love Samsung products but this wasnt good If carriers wont even sell them its a death sentence for sure I have the S7 Edge and its been great Not sure why this Note 7 has been such a disaster The Note is usually very renowned because it has the best features of the Galaxy S in a bigger form factor and more refined software The Note 7 is still that but clearly there was an issue in manufacturing and possibly even engineering in the battery,1,Negative
513,513,I do have insurance on the phone I doubt Verizon will warranty this under their 14 day policy though The phone works fine 100 and the drop really wasnt that bad There was no damage done to the side trim and the case covers the back now Ill just wait until something catastrophic happens before putting in a claim at this point,1,Negative

520,520,Yeah Im glad mine smacked the rear Im assuming mine only cracked since I heard the back glass isnt as strong,1,Negative
521,521,That phone is too expensive not to have a case on it If that were my phone I would activate the phone and leave it in the box until my case came in Good luck on whatever you decide to do,1,Negative
522,522,Go to a Verizon company store Ask the manager if you can do an emergency in store insurance claim They will call Asurion who will pay the store for the phone after they have collected your deductible That way you immediately get a brand new phone If you wait you risk getting a refurbished replacement,1,Negative
523,523,Dude what happened,2,Neutral
524,524,Well thats a Q40 which make 328hpHow fast were you going I doubt the magnet would hold up under heavy acceleration holding on to a large phone,1,Negative

527,527,Its not the cost of the case its the look of the phone that makes people go without them,2,Neutral
528,528,Thats a real pity its scary how these glass phones are so fragile Style over function I never really trusted those magnet systems especially with heavy phones Bit off topic but I tried a ridiculous amount of car holders and they all had issues A friend gave me a 1 holder and Ive had it for two years sometimes simple works best It looks a lot like this one,1,Negative
529,529,First option caseSecond option insurance Dont leave your note 7 uncovered,2,Neutral
530,530,Makes me cringe very sorry to hear,1,Negative
531,531,If you purchased it with a credit card a lot of companies will cover accidental damage in the first 30 90 days Should go check Its called buyers protection I think,1,Negative
532,532,I had the same thing happen after the 2nd day AFTER I took off a case because it was too rubbery sigh,1,Negative
533,533,Man just when I think it cant get worse than ATampT I read about the other carriers,1,Negative
534,534,They did the same thing with the S5 I currently have It was missing a lot or features The 3 I readily recall because I used them a lot on my Tmobile phones was scheduling messages the spam folder for texts and download booster All missing on Verizon,1,Negative
535,535,US Carriers are fucked up That would be completely unacceptable in most of Europe Why are Samsung even letting them do those changes,1,Negative
536,536,It really is the best phone that Ive ever held But like you said Verizon screwed with the software in a disgusting way Just leave things alone I want to leave Verizon badly but my wife isnt interested in leaving,1,Negative
537,537,Has it impacted Verizons sales to a noticeable degree Clearly it is OK,1,Negative
538,538,Good ol verizon,3,Positive
539,539,What do you mean by alternative I may have a recommendation for you,3,Positive
540,540,Because theres a large market segment that will only buy an iphone no matter what This is why Apple can release a phone in 2016 with a dual core CPU and still get sales This is Samsungs way to earn revenue from that segement,1,Negative
541,541,My phone is all glass Note 5 and rocked it naked since the day Ive opened it A couple of small knicks but not much more than what I got with a case on my last phone,1,Negative

556,556,1 If they had left a removable battery none of this recall b s would be going on We would all be getting new batteries 2 They have not released any specific information about what the triggers are for the explosions 3 All phones that use lithium ion batteries have the potential to explode the other companies have better PR teams than samsung and can keep a lid on it when this happens 4 The number of phones with issues VS The number released is ridiculously low statistically it makes no sense to have killed a good phone when they cant even replicate the explosions themselves Was it something that happened to the phone earlier that day Was the person using the extra adapter to charge the phone Was it laying in the sun or near heat in the past 24 hours There are to many variable for them to do this The whole thing has been a night mare and those of that have been through the whole debacle twice Will expect them to cough up more the 100,1,Negative

559,559,You obviously dont know how big of a company samsung is to think 3 bill out the window would shut it down lol,1,Negative
560,560,Just think about how much Samsung couldve raised profit out of note 7 and other future product in the future Its not just 3 million dollars Because note 7 ruined image of Samsung the every new product Samsung make in the future will not be sold as good as before the explosion Poor Samsung,1,Negative
561,561,There are a few things wrong with this Firstly Im sure they dont make absolutely every phone initially so I dont know maybe 10 million phones After that you have to consider the phones actual cost to make which is not any more than 300 and that ends up totalling to at most 3 billion which supports this article,1,Negative
562,562,A story this damning should spell the end of their practices This is a government and private corporation colluding to cover the truth to protect seemingly competitive advantage Its absolutely deplorable any way you look at it And for what To fuel our desire to get devices to lock us into playing Pokemon Go on prettier AMOLED screens What a fucking joke,1,Negative
563,563,I think its really interesting to note the difference in traction on two different subs for this same story On this sub a sub dedicated to Samsung knowledge announcements and products we have a humble forty plus upvotes On world news this story exploded with over 6 5k upvotes Wtf Is there just a lot of nepotism in this sub or a lack of empathy I dont get it,1,Negative

571,571,Thats my first thought Weve seen some companies have put mammoth batteries but if theres one thing thats always taken a while to adopt is large storage 32GB should have been standard many years ago but its only become that since like last year 8GB and 16GB phones are still common in fact especially on the iPhone I honestly dont even care about microSD if the internal storage is huge like 128GB or more Its a faster technology and it rules out errors from a badcheap microSD one of the thing thats impressive is the water resistance without flaps like the S5 Wonder if they can do the same with the S Pen on the Note 6,1,Negative

575,575,The S3 has MST which grants it the same functionality as Samsung pay on a normal phone Some videos around YouTube have also demonstrated it being used on both versions of the S3 so itll be there on launch Though there is some conflicting information Somewhere I read that the watch can only handle 5 purchases by itself without being connected to a galaxy phone Once connected it can do as many as you want and will be reloaded to 5 if the phone is disconnected Yet their graphic shows that full functionality of Samsung pay is available If somebody is buying this for the MST and doesnt have a galaxy phone they should wait for reviews,1,Negative

725,725,Of course its possible Look at the first version of the Note 7 They pushed out an update that prevented it from charging above 60 percent Then the Gear VR pushed out an update to prevent the Note 7 from being able to be used in the device No reason that they cant completely cripple it Then theres an even easier route Simply ban all Note 7 IMEIs from carrier networks In other words blacklist them all just like they would if it was a stolen phone For liability purposes you would think that at some point they almost have to do that Somewhere out there you could in theory have someone who doesnt know about a recall The easiest way to reach that person is to block their phone from the network Then when they call or go to a store to see the problem they will learn about the recall,2,Neutral

764,764,Sounds like you need to contact Samsung and file a claim with USPS or FedEx Either someone stole your packages or they were delivered to the wrong address For the last promo FedEx delivered my wireless chargers to my next door neighbors door step so check with your neighbors and be sure to file a complaint if they delivered to the wrong address,1,Negative
765,765,I see theyve fancied it up since I got one last year for my Note5 That one just came in a plastic bag,3,Positive
766,766,Man I signed up for that promotion and it said out of stock I bought a 10 dollar one from Amazon So at least thats something,1,Negative
767,767,50 off isnt even a great deal some people were under the impression it was going to be nearly freeDunno about korea but pretty much anywhere else you can sell a year old phone for at least half the value which is essentially what theyre offering as compensation for a major fuck upHere in Canada the S7E has a trade in value of 325 currently with every new flagship release they have a 150 200 discount if you trade in a phone and that combines with the trade in value of your phone so thats a 525 discount if the value doesnt dropUnless I misinterpreted the offer and you dont have to trade in your phone then its still pretty ass since youll have to sell it anyway if youre getting a new phone,1,Negative
768,768,cool story,3,Positive
769,769,Very disappointed its not for everyone still using Samsung devices and Im on an Edge plan with Verizon,1,Negative
770,770,I went with an S7 Edge and Im actually not too torn with the direction theyre taking this I mean they are giving us Samsung loyalists for lack of a better term 50 the newest phone via trade in Depending on when they release it if its less than a year from now you wouldnt have paid 50 of your phone off by then I know people will argue that its not enough for our troubles but its a lot better than nothing at all,1,Negative
771,771,I had the exact opposite experience Sprint wouldnt give me a refund on my note 7 they would only exchange it for a phone I didnt want I contacted Samsung and they sent me a return kit to get a full refund on the device,1,Negative

786,787,I cant say never but Ill definitely be taking a break from Samsung with the Pixel XL Maybe in a year or two Ill reevaluate after I see how Samsung has handled things and what direction Google is headed with their project,3,Positive
787,788,I dont buy it 90 of Note 7 owners got replacement Note 7s with the first recall And your title is wrong The online survey was done among Samsung phone owners not Note 7 owners It likely captures a bunch of clueless consumers who dont actually have Samsung phones,1,Negative
788,789,Theres a difference between what someone says in a survey during a period of heightened negativity towards Samsung and what they do in a year or two when they release a new phone that everyone is raving about,2,Neutral
789,790,These survey dont mean shit when youre only surveying a very small percentage of Note 7 owners,1,Negative
790,791,A survey of 1000 people doesnt say much,2,Neutral
791,792,Im taking a long break from them The note 7 was the first phone Samsung made that I really liked I have no interest in the s7 or s7e and I doubt Ill have any interest in any of their phones for awhile,1,Negative
792,793,No just a very very very small of those devices 3 4 failures per million is 6 sigma the problem is that they dont know where it is failing Since they cant reproduce the failure,0,Verynegative

810,811,TLDR Is Samsung really replacing handsets Got my phone back and the displayed battery life dropped dramatically after update So I just got my note 7 shipped to me today Went online and confirmed via the MEI number and everything Weird thing though The battery power was at 43 when I started the software update After updating the green battery icon appeared and now my battery life stood at 25 Im betting Samsung just flashed new software in all the replacement units and sent them right back out the door Their fix for those who had not yet replaced their phones was a software update that would not allow the phone to be charged above 60 of capacity,1,Negative
811,812,The iPhone 7 is a marketing disaster with the jack gone and as always with apple no goddamn important new feature except that its a cheap cashgrab as always with apple and the Note 7 literally a safety hazard I guess youre right,1,Negative

819,820,My girlfriend has the S5 and personally I like it a lot more then the S6 Where as the S6 does have its pros I think it tried to be to much like an iPhone and strip away some of its key features that made is a galaxy,1,Negative
820,821,Id also wish for a device that was CIT customer interface test tested and with an IMEI that can be linked to the date of manufacturing Since my first S5 wasnt CIT tested and the IMEI for my Tab S says it was manufactured 43 days after I purchased it,1,Negative

837,838,Hitachi is normally my go to for storage but I just replaced a four year old Seagate 750 GB HDD primary drive in a VAIO with a Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SSD Also have a Hitachi 1TB internally as secondary Couldnt be happier after fixing Windows Update Definitely worth it I probably restarted thirty times today Not one boot and log in took more than five or ten seconds I spent more time typing my password than it spent booting,0,Verynegative

841,842,Put S7 in shopping cart,2,Neutral
842,843,True no heart rate sensor and not as round as the other pictures,1,Negative
843,844,Its because the S6 is very thin and until Samsung recently came up with a new thinner camera sensor this is all they had to work with They werent about to sacrifice the camera quality so they made the camera protrude a bit,1,Negative
844,845,Good news hopefully cases covers wont cause edge shadow when taking photos,3,Positive

846,847,Like you said it is in a demo mode so I cant do everything you can to a regular phone I will say that menus are the snappier I honestly am reminded of my old iPhone back when they were king Ive only had one bad lag issue but that was after forcing the phone to exit the demo video The black is very nice and I hate black phones Havent seen the silver but thatll be the one I get,1,Negative
847,848,Had a YUUUUGE lag issue after leaving the Note 7 demo video where the phone froze for a solid 5 seconds But that happens on all other Samsungs demos So I wouldnt worry about that I almost forgot the edge was there Much nicer than the S7E where Id constantly hit the edge Fits in my hand better too Lot more natural,1,Negative
848,849,The edge is MUCH tighter As somebody who despised the edge I really like it As far as feeling the Note feels very Sturdy Comfortable to hold and use My manager is going to upgrade from his S7E he got like 2 months ago,1,Negative

852,853,No complaints from me I played a song off Youtube Katy Perry I think and it was pretty clear Bit louder than my Note 5 I actually think the S7E was the loudest out of the three Not all heroes wear capes Some just choose to play with phones while theyre bored,0,Verynegative
853,854,How is the sound quality with headphones Also do you think its worth the upgrade from a Note 5,2,Neutral
854,855,Someone told me the sound was better on the Note 7 over the S7 Edge or S7 but you said it is not as loud Can you double check it Also wonder how the battery life is but I know you can not test it because it is always plugged in,1,Negative
855,856,Unfortunately I cant set a lock up due to the demo security features I did do the iris scanner demo and it worked great Take it with a HUGE grain of salt though Im guessing you mean if Im accidentally hitting the edge like what happens with the S7E I havent done that once at all The edges are much tighter and not as prominent,1,Negative
856,857,It requires the new USB C gearvr which hasnt shipped yet,1,Negative

859,860,Not OP but I also played with a demo Note Its still plastic but it doesnt feel awful and cheap to me,1,Negative
860,861,No clue As a demo device Samsung security doesnt let me power the device off or reset,1,Negative
861,862,Should be able to Ill test in a secondEdit Looks like our store pair of headphones are MIA Ill try to remember to bring my own to test it As far as the S Pen I feel like it got a well needed face lift Much more precise and I can see myself using it for quicker note more often,3,Positive
862,863,does it have sd card integration or do you have to move apps to sd,2,Neutral
863,864,I hope this is true I passed on the S 6 and Note 5 because of this,2,Neutral

869,870,I used one of the first 14 3 Full HD chrome book 2s I thought chrome os looked like shit Unless they can figure out scaling its windows all over again isnt it That said about damn fucking time something like this makes the market,1,Negative
870,871,Same thought Samsung nailed whole curve screen thing with Note 7 They finally got a perfect balance between look and functionality,3,Positive
871,872,Yes S6 Edge had their share of problems but you should try Note 7s curve its definitely problem free,1,Negative
872,873,That edge was very big,3,Positive
873,874,I brought back my S6 edge plus the day after I got it because of this Completely unusable without a case Gambled and got a S7 Edge after that It was still a bit annoying But I could use it with no case just had random letters tossed in my sentences sometimes Have a note 7 now Works amazing with no case The edge is perfect,3,Positive
874,875,I have an S6E and and as the phone is beginning to rapidly age and get ready to go out to pasture I have to say I enjoy the edge It looks nice and I find gripping it with a case more natural than a slate phone,1,Negative
875,876,Curve on the back flat for the screen 1 Same benefits maybe better because more ergonomic like smaller easier to handle and more comfortable 2 Less accidental touches when reaching across with your thumb or holding the phone landscape the drop down menu always seems to trigger when I watch things,1,Negative
876,877,Its not perfect but I like it,1,Negative

882,883,Absolutely After recently switching from iOS to Android I love stock Android MUCH more than TouchWiz or Tizen for that matter I would not get another Samsung With that said I am REALLY loving Good Lock and Samsungs Themes With these and Package Disabler Pro Im actually at a sweet spot right now that Im VERY happy with my S6 except battery life REALLY cant wait for the new Note,1,Negative
883,884,Yeah I wish I could just get android wear on my gear s but when I look into it its all forum posts of people telling people asking that its stupid because the tizen is allows features like calling but honestly the barren app store stops me from bothering to charge the watch at all at least android wear has 3rd party support Oh and s voice is the worst voice command platform I have ever used,0,Verynegative
884,885,As nice and well built as my S7edge is the most important feature is that its an android phone Apple makes well built phones and Im sure Nokia does too But I dont like iOS or Windows phone and wouldnt buy them no matter how great the hardware is Id go Nexus or Oneplus if samsung abandoned android,1,Negative
885,886,Im not going to a barren ecosystem run by a company that would charge huge prices for even crappy apps Id switch phone brands immediately,1,Negative

890,891,Why would you dump Android I just bought the S7 Edge and Im running as close to stock android as I can I deleted or disabled as many samsung or 3rd parties apps as I could The smart idea would to run stock android and the google launcher and dump touch wiz or wiz home whatever its called Samsung hardware and Android software thats the key,1,Negative
891,892,Yup I wouldnt buy a Samsung phone without Android Id probably switch to a Nexus,1,Negative
892,893,I wouldnt care because I wouldnt be buying another device from them If they really go this way it will be a total shit show,1,Negative

894,895,No more Samsung phones for me then,2,Neutral
895,896,Agreed I have so much information tied to Google at this point that switching would be a giant pain in the ass All of my 2 step verifications lay through Google my maps reviews and so much more is with Google,1,Negative
896,897,Anyone here that says Tizen is bad because of the wearable version is really uninformed Tizen runs in so many Samsung devices and the central point of focus is usually the same advanced tech that is simple for the user and opens doors for mobile that have not been touched yet Samsung with android is nice but they havent scratched the surface with what they are capable of yet The day that Samsung releases a Tizen based mobile device is the beginning of the end for IOS,1,Negative
897,898,I got a Windows phone when Windows Phone 8 came out That was by far the best phone experience I have ever had Not perfect nothing is but a true joy to use on a daily basis Then 8 1 came out It introduced some good improvements but took away some of the best parts of 8 0 Then I installed the preview for 10 which was a huge POS in my opinion Came back to Android after that I still lament the direction MS went with Windows Phone and what could have been,1,Negative
898,899,I value Samsung brand name too much to not freak out I bought a sub par for price J5 against other competition simply because I didnt trust their after sales service,1,Negative

904,905,Theres not even enough room for 3,1,Negative
905,906,One way ticket to lose their market share I would switch to the Nexus then,1,Negative
906,907,It looks like HTC is finally turning things around This would be a great time to go back In a way I hope Samsung does as this should spell the end of Tizen and we can one day hope to see Samsung Android Wear watches hit the market Edit grammar,1,Negative
907,908,As much as I think Samsung makes good phones not really Id probably just get an HTC,1,Negative
908,909,Thats why Google sold Motorola to Lenovo to keep Samsung happy If they were going to attempt this they should have done it years ago,1,Negative
909,910,If this meant what it currently means for my S Gear 2 piss poor app selection laughably bad voice recognition from S Voice no Google Now or Google apps integration then off to Nexus and Android Wear I go,1,Negative

913,914,I want Google Android more than I want samsung,1,Negative
914,915,I love Andoid OSSoftware way more than Samsung HardwareDesign If Samsung drops Android then my next upgrade would be too the next best Android device after that I litterally cant imagine owning a cellphone tablet without the Google Play Store,2,Neutral
915,916,at first probably not but to be 100 hones if samsung does good with tizen and makes it actual competition for android or IOS then i would consider it,2,Neutral
916,917,My first one got very hot and would lag so bad,2,Neutral
917,918,That color is so pretty Anyways if a reboot didnt fix it then the flex cable is probably just partially lifted Quick fix if you have the tools otherwise just bring it into a repair shop,1,Negative
918,919,Ded,2,Neutral
919,920,rglitch art,3,Positive
920,921,When I overclocked my phone to 2 3 Ghz on core and 800 Mhz GPU this happened to me once I unlocked my phone One restart later and it worked properly In rest I didnt OC it anymore and it works properly now,3,Positive

924,925,MST wasnt available on the S2 and the addition of it on any Android phone is a huge bonus Youve just upgraded your phone to pay for stuff on just about any magnetic card reader,1,Negative
925,926,Seems a bit crazy that their brand new product is getting a Black Friday sale,1,Negative
926,927,I would definitely say so yes I had the S2 since release these new designs and features makes me wan na upgrade Though its really up to your wrist size,1,Negative
927,928,The S3 had some minor UI and software tweaks Will those make their way to the S2 Classic I have no need for the new features and the S3 is a bit too big i think,1,Negative
928,929,Theres a beta for the iOS right now as far as the Gear Manager goes Pretty soon im sure theyll release the final product,1,Negative
929,930,Well as far as inbox and hangouts you wont get a separate app available on tizrn you simply get notifications and can reply to them As far as google now unfortunately the tizen os forces you to use s voice Its kinda awkward anyways to talk to your watch rather than just your phone As far as experience difference just expect less app selection for tizen Its still a good os for the watch though very smooth,1,Negative
930,931,Im a big screen person so Im HYPED I was hoping theyd make AN S2 with a bigger screen but this is even better As a Nexus 6 owner and now a Note7GS2 owner Yessss Plz,1,Negative
931,932,Tizen honestly isnt bad Been using my Gear S2 with no problem Only gripe i have is the lack of variety of apps thats it,1,Negative
932,933,Ikr Though the pricing im concerned about since it looks rugged and has sporty features I hope its not as expensive as the Garmin Fenix 3 which is around 500 or hopefully it doesnt get as expensive as 400,1,Negative
933,934,Im relieved I already spent 880 because there was a phone that was slightly better than mine I didnt want to pony another 350 for a watch My beloved S2 is safe looking all svelte on my wrist,1,Negative

935,936,LOVE the IR blaster on the note 4 they better include it in the 7,1,Negative
936,937,Its a flat screen variant Lots of people including myself dont want an edge version,1,Negative
937,938,Pure marketing and probably a good idea The S7s are out and appear to be on an annual release cycle now with the Note The iPhone 7 is likely around the corner They dont want an uninformed consumer to think that the Note 6 means previous generation,3,Positive
938,939,Hello beautiful Come here often,3,Positive
939,940,Agree,2,Neutral
940,941,While I love my Note 2 especially with the Note 4 based Eclipse v8 rom I really looking forward to upgrading to the Note 7 or S7 edge even though Im not sure I the edge variant actually makes sense for me,2,Neutral

944,945,If this is truly it bye bye my note 4,2,Neutral
945,946,Its really difficult to protect with a casescreen protector because the need to access the bottom of the curve Plus it is more likely to break than a flat screen,1,Negative
