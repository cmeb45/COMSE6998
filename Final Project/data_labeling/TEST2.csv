55,1055,Rumors are rumors Wait 2 days before judging when we have concrete facts,2,Neutral
56,1056,Then its not for you The spen isnt gimmicky its actually really useful I used the shit out of mine when I had the note 2 and note 3 I jumped from the Note 3 to the S6 Active and miss the crap out of it Cant say 100 until they officially launch and release specs but I think Im sold on it The biggest drawback is no IR blaster,1,Negative

226,1226,Im a T mobile rep and I believe it did hurt the Samsung brand a bit Most of the time I recommend an S7 or S7E customers ask me if thats the exploding phone Sometimes people just come in and ask if we are still selling the exploding phone As a Samsung fan it does kind of annoy me since people arent aware of how good these devices are,1,Negative

295,1295,This is good to know Its sad to see that a tech company would to allow themselves to interfere with the user experience in such an intrusive way This only sets a precedent that may continue to be followed well into the future Smart TVs just sound like a hindrance when I can so easily replicate and surpass the experience offered by Smart TVs by simply buying a substantially cheaper high resolution non Smart TV and slapping a Chromecast on it On a side note I find it funny that the site hosting this article employs some pretty annoying and intrusive ads as well,1,Negative

329,1329,This is because USB C cables are reversible EDIT The ridges are to help identify which side of the USB cable is up so that you can essentially plug in the micro USB cable into your phone without much effort As USB C cables can go in either way the design of the ridges are no longer needed Would look pretty weird with ridges on both sides and having it on one side would habituate people into plugging in USB C cables only one way,1,Negative
330,1330,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you may have the USB 3 speeds On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere And none of those will work on the new phone However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier,1,Negative
331,1331,Fine by me as long as it has wireless charging Its nice having a bunch of micro usb cords around but I use them for what they are for Headphones xbox one controller etc etc So I really only have one cord and that is what came in the box,1,Negative

392,1392,I doubt they will release an edge variant without the normal flat version Their edge models havent been as popular and it would be foreseeable mistake,1,Negative
393,1393,TBH before I bought my Note 5 I was deciding really hard whether to get it or the s6e one with the legendary spen and spen benefits or one with the sexy dual curves for looks and display effect and now if the note67 comes with both then I would actually be happier with that,1,Negative
394,1394,My understanding is they kinda have to they developed a certain chip with 3gb and improved it the easiest improvement was just doubling shit or something like thatHonestly 6gb would be nice at least theres little chance of memory issues,3,Positive
395,1395,yes so the note series and S series can be on the same number,2,Neutral

422,1422,During my search I found someone that said they had to get the phone replaced I think it was on a older note though It was disconcerting to see the pen not work over the magnetized area It would be nice to know for sure The magnet mount I was using was nice,1,Negative
423,1423,It does it with the Note 5 as well As soon as I take my case off though its completely fine,1,Negative
424,1424,Luckily I noticed this issue the first time I stuck it to the mount so I dont know about prolonged use The fact that the S Pen doesnt work on the magnetized area was enough for me to pull it off and be done with it The screen works as intended now,1,Negative

434,1434,My credit union was added but I use big bank credit cards anyway Honestly most of the people who complain about their banks not being supported should just get a credit card from a bank that is I dont know if there are many people who realize the advantages of using credit cards over debit cards Especially for fraudulent charges It can take weeks or months to get your money back if someone fraudulently uses your debit card but one phone call reverses a fraudulent charge on a credit card,1,Negative

436,1436,Youre not missing much Went around town a few days ago to try and use it so I could get the 30 gift certificate took 3 different stores until it actually worked So embarrassing to fumble with your phone tell the cashier oh no it should work and then have it fail and have to fish out your wallet,1,Negative

462,1463,I hope Samsung is going to continue to support S2 Classics since I have one There is no reason why they should abandon them except for wanton greed Stand by the product and keep customers These watches are not inexpensive I would probably buy the S5 once it comes around if the features are so much better But if they fail to update the ware on my S2 I am going to think twice,1,Negative

472,1473,SpeninfraredirisscannngvrheadsetSuperhdscreenMotherfuckas,2,Neutral
473,1474,I mean if you buy a device on a payment plan it means that you have to buy the device entirely and not get a discount on it Meanwhile if you sign a 2 year contract I can get 550 off on the device for agreeing to stay with the carrier for 2 years Since the device payment plan breaks it down over 24 months anyways isnt it beneficial to buy it under a 2 year contract I honestly dont care if I get locked down for two years unless hidden fees applyAlso I do know that T mobile has more perks but they dont have 2 year contracts According to my logic above wouldnt it be beneficial to stay with VZW Also my parents are with Verizon so we can get the 4 lines for 150 deal which is actually pretty sweet My parents just hate the idea of having to leave a carrier theyve been with for 10 years,1,Negative
474,1475,Coming from a GN5 I would LOVE the s pen but idk Being a teen I can really benefit from having a phone asap But that 4x4MIMO is also very sexy,1,Negative
475,1476,I would do the Note in all honesty Its still an amazing phone However I have to wait til September to get mine I have a striking feeling they may come up with a more advanced version with how they are currently in other countries So the wait may be worth it but you need it now If I were you I would figure out what I want and what the most important things are in a phone you want Then check off any pros and cons with each version until you settle with what has the better features for you I feel the Note 7 will offer more especially with the extra features it has Plus if you make a habit out of using the pen you may grow addicted to using it I forced myself to use it after not using it for a year That whole year I feel like I missed out on its full potential and ever since I have never gone a day without using the pen Its incredibly useful for what I do and I dont think I could be any more efficient with an S series phone than the Notes Especially with how much they expanded on the pen features I am excited to get the N7,1,Negative
476,1477,S pen is awesome in using it right now to type this message Browsing around with the pen is tight as hell too,3,Positive
477,1478,I dont know why you are being down voted either I also hope that this one is black like the s7 is I own an s6 edge and youre right its more of a dark blue which doesnt bother me but I would rather have a black phone,1,Negative
478,1479,Source,2,Neutral
479,1480,Id REALLY hoped for a flat model but I guess I dont mind this render It looks as though the edges are toned down compared to the S7 edge,1,Negative
480,1481,The s pen is going to be completely useless on the edges How am i supposed to use this for note taking now They basically shrunk the screen usefulness size to make it pretty They are slowly making this line of phones original purpose obsolete This is really frustrating,1,Negative

530,1531,I honestly dont understand why they would do it for the Note line I feel what separates the Note line for the S is the productivity The Note is geared towards productivity while the S is full of the fancy gimmicks I dont see how having edges will add productivity especially if it makes it more difficult to navigate with the stylus,1,Negative

650,1651,It looks like the design might be taking a Note 5S6 approach where the flat side of the phone is opposite between the two That being said I cant say the thin frame all around the phone has much appeal I like the previous design where it stays thin on the sides and larger on the top and bottom Gives the curved glass side a nicer look instead of the bubble Guess well see how it looks when officially presented though,1,Negative

738,1739,I have mine the only time I was a little worried was when the system updated today and the phone ran a little hot Put it under a cold rinse and its running cool now Thats literally the only time its run hotter than warm for me Since I got my phone at launch its ran cool to warm every single time even when I was initially downloading and running dozens of apps for the first few days Unfortunately my local T Mobile stores cant get it restocked enough though as they only got 40 units yesterday and ran out almost immediately I might have to wait until Monday to get it replaced,1,Negative

747,1748,Yup upon reading an article describing the issue that stated 0 1 I thought maybe I should because 0 1 of 2 5 million is still 2500 devices That number was inaccurate because the actual reported number of cases was 35 which is 0 0014 Basically a slim af chance that youll have an exploding battery but not impossible Im waiting until I can walk in and exchange,1,Negative

790,1791,they still sell it on their official website weird they are making a recall before selling it,2,Neutral
791,1792,Agreed Im gon na hold on and gather more info on these new replacement phones catching fire and in the mean time Ill continue to use my note This phone is beautiful,1,Negative
792,1793,Just spoke to Carphone Warehouse in the UK and theyre still waiting for update from Samsung regarding our options but said the phone is being discontinued altogether I e there wont be any more safe replacement note 7s Fuck,1,Negative
793,1794,youll be fine with the iPhone 6 iOS 10 brings some new life into older devices,3,Positive
794,1795,From where did you purchase the phone itself On the link it appears as though and I may be entirely wrong so forgive me Samsung is refunding the accessories When I return my Note 7 to Verizon I intend on bringing the receipts for accessories that I purchased at Best Buy to see if this is indeed the case It may not be but it makes sense for Samsung to bear the burden of refunding accessories Edit an earlier iteration of this link mentioned accessories It looks like they have since removed that section,1,Negative
795,1796,What a joke what an absolute joke What the fuck are they doing They already fixed them right This will destroy the Note series I have never seen a tech disaster like this before Handed in my Note 7 yesterday Good fuck it Not worth the hassle dealing with Samsung again,2,Neutral
796,1797,Its ridiculously hard to get unlocked phones in Canada so they are probably more lenient due to that,1,Negative

798,1799,My s7 edge broke on a rug over concrete from 13 My s5 was dropped almost weekly This will be my last Samsung phone Hope their engineering department reads these posts,1,Negative
799,1800,The note 3 uses Gorilla Glass 3 which was essentially tank like on my nexus 6,1,Negative
800,1801,For everyone shitting on Corning its not a weakness of Gorilla Glass 5 its a weakness of Samsung insisting that they curve the glass Bending the glass makes it SO much weaker its not designed to be curved like that and Corning are not to blame,1,Negative
801,1802,Sorry to hear that the funny thing is i got this phone after insurance paid me for my broken galaxy s7 edge,3,Positive
802,1803,I cracked my N7 on day 2 It fell from my hammock to dirt about 2 feet and cracked the front screen My N4 is in a red pepper case It gets dropped weekly and has no issues,1,Negative
803,1804,R I P,2,Neutral
804,1805,I dreamed I had a note 7 and cracked it,3,Positive
805,1806,I broke three Note 5s in 72 days earlier this year The first time it would have broke if it were made of diamond the second time was a toss up but the last time was a joke It fell half a foot Now I never had a case so I am not removing my responsibility but I drop my Galaxy S5 all the time sometimes majestically and it didnt break before or now I love the Note and really want to get the 7 but is this still an issue,1,Negative
806,1807,Gorilla glas isnt mroe solid IMHO dropped my note 4 from 1 5m on a tile floor which completly shattered the screen Unlucky,3,Positive
807,1808,Do you have a link to this I wasnt aware of such thing,1,Negative
808,1809,They are regular film protectors i just said glass protectors as in front and rear glass Sorry for the confusionthose are the ones i picked up at the store when i picked up the phone,1,Negative
809,1810,They actually say 80 chance of survival from 1 6 m high which is head height,1,Negative
810,1811,They claim its actually just the metal from the pick rubbing off But yeah it seems its supposed to be more shatter resistant but more scratchable,1,Negative
811,1812,Oh man you do have me beat,3,Positive
812,1813,lols,2,Neutral
813,1814,I have a line on mine this is my first high end phone I dont know what to do the crack isnt noticeable unless put above white background and can barely be seen unless you look at it from an angle I can feel the crack tho its a thin line across the screen I dont know what to do Should I just buy a screen protector and put it on Because the crack is small and bare seeable,1,Negative
814,1815,If you cant do without or think you want all the new s pen features I say its worth it Otherwise if you dont need a stylus go without,2,Neutral
815,1816,Does anyone know if the note 7 will have the same cooling as the s7 and s7 edge Im thinking about getting it but I dont want to have overheating issues like the s6 since I do plan on getting the gear vr with it,1,Negative
816,1817,There is nothing the S7 Edge can do that the Note 7 couldnt The Note 7 is pretty much a slightly bigger slightly improved and slightly more refined S7 Edge with an S Pen The difference is really only about 100 and not 200 like you stated talking about new Its really a question of if you use S Pen or not There just isnt enough differentiating feature and I wouldnt even say the price is that big of a difference between the 2 phones,1,Negative
817,1818,At least in the US the official unlocked version is 779 and Note 7 is 850 which is what the US unlocked version of Note 7 will cost once it releases in couple of months What S7 edge costs 650 Are you talking about the international unlocked models without warranty Samsung pay dont work etc So its definitely worth 70 to 100 actual price difference,1,Negative
818,1819,If you would utilize full use out of the pen yes Plus it still has some features the S7 doesnt have I heard the sound quality is improved thats a mouth to ear thing though My justification of getting it is that I heavily used the pen It was great at writing quick notes easy place to have a quick screen grab and I just always used it for a multitude of things I didnt use it a lot early on but I spent time with it and made it a habit to use and I realized that the s pen is much more than a regular stylus It is a proper functionality feature that has a hell lot of potential for the Note,0,Verynegative
819,1820,Preordered yesterday Feel in hand is second to none for me Got my 6p on Swappa,1,Negative
820,1821,I wouldnt say so More rigid build due to higher quality aluminum Gorilla Glass 5 Improved screen 50 brighter at max HDR compatibility Vastly improved UX S Pen Iris scanner a gimmick for most people USB C USB 3 1 Slightly larger screen and dimensions 100mAh smaller battery Less curved display Significantly better in hand feel,1,Negative
821,1822,Is a s pen worth 200 to you,3,Positive
822,1823,It depends on your use case The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen has the iris scanner as a security option and of course the greatly improved S Pen and the more fine tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it get the Note If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge Theyre both great phones it just depends on what feel is the most important part some more features or saving money,1,Negative
823,1824,Whats the difference between GG4 and GG5,2,Neutral
824,1825,If you want the S Pen then there are enough other small improvements to make it worth the price However if you dont like the S Pen then I dont think those small improvements are enough to justify 100 200 by themselves,1,Negative
825,1826,Its not an easy decidion Nonetheless do you prefer bigger phones Would you use the stylus,2,Neutral
826,1827,Easily worth the extra 200 Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you can not get to the finger print scanner USB 3 1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features I would pay more for anyone of those but to add them all together is a bargain for 200,3,Positive

845,1846,I think the screen protectors may come out maybe eventually but then theyll have adhesive problems like everything else,1,Negative
846,1847,You got the zagg tempered glass screen protector They dont even have it on their website And yes people still use screen protectors because my galaxy s7 glass isnt scratch proof no one has a screen that can prevent scratches,1,Negative

891,1892,Im sorry that you had this experience with T Mobile With rates that cheap they have to cut corners somewhere right It used to be that youd be stuck with a terrible network with them now that thats improved I guess its customer service and lack of uniformity in corporate store policies,1,Negative
892,1893,T Mobile locations are absolute shit The T Mobile phone supervisors are the absolute best If you ever have a huge problem like this speak directly to a supervisor and explain what theyre doing wrong Ive had a supervisor give us a 200 credit in the past You ended up getting free phones somehow because the supervisors are the only ones that get stuff done,1,Negative
893,1894,ATampT user here and I had the same experience Literally walked into my store returned the phone and that was it Maybe were lucky I dont know but that was a painless 5 minute return for me and it seems like on Reddit theres another person every day with issues of exchange or return on a worldwide recall Granted I didnt have to do an exchange as I have a backup phone but I cant imagine its significantly more difficult I guess the big issue here is if you can wait for the note 7 replacement or not I personally will be fine without the note 7 for a few more weeks as Im not going to die without it which seems to be the case for most people online,0,Verynegative
894,1895,Im sorry you had such a sour experience I just moved back to t mobile after a miserable time with VZW I must have gotten lucky I tried 1 store while at work and it was clear they had no idea what they were doing Stopped by another on my way home and it was night and day the whole process took 25 minutes because of content transferring between the note and s7 edge,1,Negative

897,1898,I decided to phone an exchange in and do the transferbackup myself I made sure to ask about how the temporary exchange would work Waiting on the phone in the mail IMHO its far easier than dealing with a person trying to do it in store regardless of carrier or store I did go in store initially but he actually talked me out of exchanging it Weird,1,Negative
898,1899,My SO and I are having the same problems with t mobile Got ta be sure your dealing with a Corp owned store My first problem was going into a t mobile independently owned store They are the absolute worst in service and complete assholes Ive been calling t mobile over 9 times my boyfriend has 3 times We went to one location the shitty one then the good store It took over 3 hours for the two stores and we were almost late for work We now have loaner phones we had to pay taxes for and yesterday a t mobile phone support was going to call me back to order our new phones the iPhone 7 plus Our bill is over 700 Were stuck with free tablets because the shitty store pressured us to get them Then after signing the papers he tells us theres a 75 restocking fee for each tablet Loyalty dept wont take back the free tablets cause their not technically accessories but they are since you cant get them without ordering a note 7 And our note 7s could have blow out our eyes cause the phone got fucking hot using it with a gear vr I dont know what to do anymore Its been so stressful with everything Now Im afraid these s7 loaners are somehow gon na be our upgrades and we wont get the actual phone we want Weve been with t mobile for 4 yrs Were thinking of selling everything that has a line phones tablets smart watch ue boom and ipad and buying I phones through apple instead Im so tired of t mobile so called support They dont do shit but placate you or like in the store you got associate yelling at another coworker on the phone Its a shot show and its not totally t mobile fault but it is And its also Samsung fault too They made a battery that has created over 2 million people that have lost their shit on people just doing their job or in some cases they employees aint doing nothing to help Rant over,1,Negative

912,1913,Not my screen but my back glass broke about 3 months after I got the phone I dropped it while I was sleeping The phone was next to me while charging and I guess my arm got caught on the cord and the phone was pretty much just thrown onto a concrete floor I am glad my screen is fine though,1,Negative
913,1914,I just broke my S7 Edge yesterday Had it for a month and a half I shattered the back glass when it didnt have a case on shattered the front with a case on Luckily its by the button and not in the middle of the screen Maybe sprint will let me upgrade to the Note 7 if I pay extra,1,Negative
914,1915,I feel like the only case that will protect the screen is a smart cover case,3,Positive
915,1916,Oh man I was hoping there was a thread regarding this I had a 5s before my note 7 and have been worryong about the screens integrity In the 2 years I had my 5s the entire phone held up like a champ I never once replaced the screen or phone My concern with the note 7 was the edge style screen Im curious about peoples experiences with Samsungs other edge style phones as well though as well as what case would potentially work best for the note 7,1,Negative
916,1917,Count me in for that sad club Bought it on Friday smashed the upper left corner on Saturday Case came yesterday It doesnt interfere with functionality and a little bit of its beauty is blemished but the water resistance is done So I will pay to get it fixed T Mobile washes its hands of the whole thing sent me to Samsung Edit Reason I dropped it Had it on my lap about 18 off the pavement and that damn glass back is sooo slippery,1,Negative

928,1929,One thing Ive seen Asurion do is get a lot more streamlined I originally had a 2014 Moto X but the screen cracked They sent me an S5 as they had no Moto Xs in stock A couple months later Im at work using my phone and put it down to take a call on the landline While on the call the screen shut off like normal to save power After the call I picked my S5 back up but the screen wouldnt turn on I tried everything Battery restart etc and nothing was working but the phone would still vibrate that indicates it was accepting input Called up Asurion and told them their replacement device they sent me stopped working for absolutely no reason and they having no S5 or Moto Xs in stock sent me a nice new gold S6 A couple of years ago it felt like Id be on the phone with Asurion for 2 hours but recently it seems like a 20 minute call at most is all I need to make,1,Negative
929,1930,All I had to do to submit my claim is go to their website sppmobileclaims com and submit a claim using the phone number that I gave them when I bought protection plus They called me next day to confirm what I said on the claim The second claim went really wrong though because they sent me a letter saying they never received my old device so they were going to charge me 400 I called them at the official number they have on their website and the rep Just said I have to call USPS and give them the tracking number and say it was never delivered and USPS will give me a claim number and to just give that to an spp rep and I wouldnt have to pay anything They connect you to an actual person when you call the number really quickly and they are good at what they do Id rate them up there with Amazons customer service Im thinking you were calling the wrong number and were talking to insurance for T Mobile or any other cellular provider that also deals with them and not Samsung protection plus which use the same insurance company This is their correct number you call it or visit the website I mentioned earlier only those will put you in direct contact with their spp department and not their other departments,1,Negative

962,1963,I upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the S7 Edge and love it I definitely couldnt wait for the S8 and was well due for an upgrade still arguably one of the best Android phones out there along with the 6P Note 7 and maybe the Moto Z,3,Positive
963,1964,What it comes down to is if you want the phone now or in six months time ish The S7 is a top phone,2,Neutral
964,1965,Waiting for S8,2,Neutral
965,1966,If thats the only two phones you are looking at then S7 for sure You wont see a massive difference in performance since there is no 10nm yet But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7 I suggest this because Google phones are updated and most secure android phones you will ever find,1,Negative
966,1967,I am in the same predicament I was gon na go with the note 7 I always wait for the storm to ride out as I call it the beta test and thankfully so Since its big recall I am too scared to mess with it anymore So Im waiting for the S8 edge its just about 5 6 months away look at it as 137 days away,1,Negative
967,1968,Not to be a dick but why would it increase the life of his phone,1,Negative
968,1969,Wait for the S8 It will be awesome and announced earlier,2,Neutral
969,1970,The s8 is reportedly going to be out Q1 or Q2 2017 depends if you can wait that long The s8 will be better than the s7 but the s7 is still a top notch phone,1,Negative
970,1971,I think really at this point the S7 has everything you need I personally went with the S7 Edge But wireless charging water resistant great camera great screen its really the whole package Only thing lacking if you could even call it lacking USB C,1,Negative
971,1972,If you can just wait it out The s8 will obviously be better and even if you dont like it you can get an s7 for cheaper by then,1,Negative
972,1973,I am with U S Cellular they are the only coverage in my rural area and they have a pretty limited phone selection They dont sell the Moto phones anymore which would be my second choice,1,Negative
973,1974,Im waiting to see what the S8 will be like,2,Neutral
974,1975,I think I will go with the S16 9,2,Neutral
975,1976,I switched from a 6s to an S7 love it High quality phone for sure The screen is glorious gorilla glass too,3,Positive
976,1977,I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7 having to return it under the recall I really never got used to the edge thing and battery life was not near even my 2 year old 6 but it was OK I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time Battery life is also kinda short depending on what the phone is doing but it feels like less than the 6 most of the time I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor Nirvana to me would be Android OS on an iPhone For now Im going back to iPhone not because Im in love with the OS or the customer hostile attitude but just because I feel like I can have the thing for years and know that it wont explode or shatter or mysteriously die without it at least being under a better warranty than mail it in and wait 2 weeks while we find a way to blame you Assuming youre not concerned about the build quality then the S7 is a fine phone Its bigger than the non plusses and large enough that I can still fat finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it If you can overlook the neon glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing Ive seen especially at night when the black screen background is black And being able to get content on and off of it without iTunes cancer is miraculous in and of itself Chrome on Android kills Safari even on IOS 10 IMO I dont think youd be missing anything going to the S7 if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem As long as it doesnt explode or shatter Also compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster most of the time there is no waiting for things to load but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device,1,Negative
977,1978,I am in the same bloody boat Currently using Note5 wanted to get a Note7 when it came out but then the phones were recalled and whole exploding battery fiasco thing kind of scared me Decided to go for an iPhone7 but seeing the reviews and even the speed tests I am not sure it is worth the money and I am back to block 1 Should I get the Note7 when it launches with safe batteries get an S7 Edge or wait for an S8 So fucking torn between these three choices,1,Negative
978,1979,If only it wasnt ATampT exclusive Id consider it if there was an unlocked International version,1,Negative
979,1980,I currently have the S7 Edge in Onyx Black So worth it,3,Positive
980,1981,Wait If for no other reason for price drops of the older models once the new model comes out,2,Neutral
981,1982,Oh man im also torn at the moment Im using an iPhone 6 right now and have been doing since it was released and im happy with the phone but im kind of tired with Apple locking everything down iPhone 7 is just Apple helping me with the decision to switch over Im sure i would be really happy with the S7 but im also afraid that ill regret not waiting for the S8 when its released,1,Negative
982,1983,Its risky because they can stop paying their phone plan and you end up with a blacklisted phone,2,Neutral
983,1984,I recently came from an iPhone 6 to an S7 Edge It is an amazing phone and Im not worried about newer phones like the S8 coming out This is because there isnt really anything that this phone is missing It has a bloody massive battery great screen micro SD card support IP68 water resistance etc The S8 will most likely have the new iris scanner but honestly a finger print scanner is more practical and probably faster What Im saying is that the S7 difference from an S8 wont be that big especially when you previously used an iPhone,1,Negative
984,1985,19th September or October I was told Id get mine carphone warehouse too 2nd October,1,Negative
985,1986,Same Not giving up my phone unless there is like a super ridiculous time frame like January 2017 Especially not going to iPhone again because I just got done transferring everything over it seems like Hopefully the early October like they said is the later date,0,Verynegative
986,1987,I prefer USB C Coming from iPhone I cant imagine having to actually look and see which way the cord goes in each time Sounds archaic Not to mention the 64gb internal which is important for us folks who keep all our porn in Secure Folder which doesnt allow storing on the SD card Also the screen is brighter AND dimmer,1,Negative
987,1988,I had something similar happen to me I had a Note 4 which was a great phone But the motherboard started to go out Its resetting itself and freezing and now is stuck in a constant reboot loop I argued with Sprint for 4 DAYS over them getting me out of my contract and selling me the phone with their new contract price because I didnt want to spend 850 on it I finally got them to agree to drop my contract and start a new one so I can get the phone I put in an order for 2 of them one for me and one for my wife Then I wake up the next day and the phone has been recalled Never even shipped it to me Now my Note 4 is 100 dead and Im using my wifes old S5,0,Verynegative
988,1989,Do you still have your note or have you traded it in,2,Neutral
989,1990,Samsung pinpointed the issue and resolved it a good while ago now And replacement units were shipped out to stores However folks demanded the government step in with an official recall Rather than waiting even longer for that Samsung consulted with the Consumer Product Safety Commission Now youre all waiting for word from the CPSC before the phones can actually be released The original timetable had exchange units in stores by today or Friday Now its out of Samsungs hands,1,Negative
990,1991,I stopped by best buy today just for curiosity and was told the replacement shipments were shipped out Monday Whether or not that was factual I have no way of verifying but I also did not purchase my phone there employee account so he really had no incentive to lie to me,1,Negative
991,1992,Trust me even we dont actually know,2,Neutral
992,1993,Thanks for the recommendation Ill download it today and try it out,3,Positive
993,1994,Upvote for the humor I had a good laugh I went from Samsung keyboard to Swiftkey now I use Google keyboard You can type a word then select it in the recommendation bar up top to add it to memory Alas I can cuss all day long without spell check,1,Negative
994,1995,When comparing with the iPhone 5 keyboard and autocorrect which I owned and used for around a year before I purchased a Samsung S6 Edge have now had for a year also I found the autocorrect for the iPhone was far nicer At first I put it down to just getting used to the new phones nuances but since then Ive realised I did just find typing a text less cumbersome on the iPhone I frequently have to delete the autocorrection because the phone didnt recognise the word refill out the edited part then hit space only to have it autocorrect again I dont know exactly why but this I think has been one of the bigger issues Ive had with switching that just hasnt settled in every other difference is now just normal and I struggle to remember how to navigate an iPhone,1,Negative
995,1996,Not sure why youd want to drop so far down in performance but to each their own I suppose,1,Negative
996,1997,My Note 4 was great and aged amazing The only drawback was battery it would reach a certain point and then jump to very low numbers Like it would go to 20 or 24 and drop to either 0 or 8 Could be the battery or I could have damaged something with leaving it someplace hot because that seems to be the case with battery issues Ive seen,2,Neutral
997,1998,This I had iPhone4 then sgs3 now sgs5 and thinking of what to switch to next I miss the smoothness of iPhone but keep remembering that end of 2 years of iPhone4 when I was so tired of the phone With my sgs5 I can throw on a new launcher or get rid of all my old widgets and install new ones to tide me over till more options come out,1,Negative
998,1999,I see the whole IOS is optimized for the hardware argument being thrown around a lot I left IOS because the updates slowed my iPhone down to the point where it was almost unusable Got ta love that optimization Ive been using a Note 5 since the end of last year The phone has gotten faster with updates particularly MM The software experience is actually really good and its highly customisable The hardware is the selling point for these phones You get the best phone screen on the market Period Awesome battery life An amazing camera Wireless charging Premium build quality Expandable storage Waterproofing Samsung pay works in more places Anything prior to the Note 4 is going to give a less than stellar representation of the Samsung experience as prior to that It honestly was a bad experience Samsung have taken their game to the next level with their recent phones especially the S7 series,1,Negative
