2,2,From what Ive seen it can happen at any moment. Its caused by heat being fed too much power while charging as a result of bad power regulator design. Basically the battery Samsung ordered from their supplier shouldnt be exploding under the heat it gets. But the power regulator in the phone is failing causing the excess heat in the first place. So the batteries would be 100 fine if samsung didnt fail on their end. TLDR Dont charge it in your car with AC off in summer. Dont charge it on your bed or any cloth. Dont charge it in a hot kitchen. Dont charge it anywhere that can cause it to retain heat.,2016-09-10 19:05:04,Note 7 Bedside Charging Station

32,32,My s7e is my first Samsung phone. And its firmly put them in high regards in my book. I used to laugh at reps when they would show me a Samsung.

33,33,People dont care. GM had ignition issues people died from I remember Jeeps and Teslas catching fire none of these come to mind when the average carbuyer looks at cars now. If you put the pen from the last note in wrong it broke no one remembers that. I think the issue is seen as less serious than it was. It was an issue that only occurred in certain circumstances and you had a lot of people going mines fine can I keep it. with a response no be safe. I think people start to wonder if the issue was overblown Samsungs quick response looked more better safe than sorry than oh shit or at least enough. Also when you hear some phones are ok you start to wonder if the explosions came from unusual circumstance. This was restricted to one device. Had S7s started smoking the company would be fucked. But one device with a history of solid Galaxy SNote phones sitting on the rack next to the S7 which was fine this looked a contained problem. I dont think anyone expects an exploding Note 8. Samsung has a sizable customer base built on phones like Grand Prime Galaxy On5 and J3. Prepaid phones bought because Samsung who makes flagship phones is better than Alcatel who no one has heard of. These users dont care. Note 7 is some super expensive slim fancy superphone and has nothing to do with what I bought off the Walmart rack. I have an On5 and while this Note 7 business might give me pause buying an S8 or Note 8 if Im still looking at prepaids Im still gonna go Samsung.,2016-11-03 18:58:12,"86% of smartphone users would still buy a Samsung phone, despite Note7 disaster."

37,37,Maybe. Im really not sure at all what conditions cause the defect to occur. Qualcomm I believe still does their power management so if the quick charge itself was the issue we would see this on other devices.

72,72,I just called Samsung uk to tell them this not in those words exactly but since our alternative solutions to the note 7 problem are just to get a refund and a new contract I asked if theres any way an actual solution like this could happen. After some talking and being left on hold while she discussed with a manager she genuinely I hope made a note on my account and said to wait for a call back. It might be that they are not aware that this sort of solution would help to make the situation better for note 7 users.. Id advise everyone in this situation call Samsung and let them know this option of getting a replacement s7 phone and an automatic upgrade when a new model is released would convince you to stay with Samsung and return your note 7. It might at least help to make this a reality.,2016-10-18 03:59:08,Samsung is considering giving Note 7 owners that switched to an S7/S7E the option to swap for an S8/Note 8

The bigger screen was really appealing as was the functionality of the edge without the drastic bevel.,2016-10-12 00:02:15,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
110,110,..... are you me. Seriously though same exact situation. I switched from the Note 3 to the pre ordered 7 decided to splurge and get the accessories came with the Gear Fit bought a wireless charging pad and Gear VR. It truly is everything I want in a phone and it works with the accessories so well. Now Im trying to figure out what to do.,2016-10-12 08:17:36,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
111,111,Note 5 isnt terrible. The exynos is still no slouch even though its outdated.,2016-10-12 10:21:24,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
112,112,I also had a Note 7 2 months after I bought a OnePlus 3 enjoyed it for about 2 weeks and loved the sh out of it before the explosion reports. Unfortunately not even the Pixel XL can compare. You wont find features such as water resistance s pen and dual sim on the Pixel XL. The Pixel hardware is nice but Googles default android software is so... basic. The Note 7 had so many features bloat. added by Samsung that I really liked. I am now back to using my OnePlus 3 and I dont know what to get. The only thing standing between me and a Pixel or even a HTC 10 is the dual sim feature.,2016-10-12 05:03:29,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User

114,114,Compared to the note 7...you have no idea. Its very outdated.,2016-10-12 00:09:50,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
115,115,I share your sentiments exactly. Nothing out there is as good as the note 7 was so Im just going to hold onto my s6 edge. If the S8 impresses me Ill probably buy one of those although I will miss the S pen. Its just a waiting game now.,2016-10-11 19:58:42,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
116,116,I agree with you Although I have a note 5 which Im surprised to say Im decently content with.... I finally got the wife to upgrade from her s4 and shes absolutely gutted she wants her note 7 back in a bad way and the s7 edge doesnt really cut it So Im in the same place might end up giving the kids an s7 edge when theres a note 7 replacement.,2016-10-11 20:04:35,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User

119,119,I would call it the Ford Pinto of phones,2016-10-11 20:13:51,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
120,120,My theory with the note 7 and apple 7 is that the phones have no way to cool down since theyre so air tight in order to be water proof...maybe thats helping things overheat to the point that they just start to fail and poof. Man... Anyone know when the LG v20 is coming out .,2016-10-12 08:43:03,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
121,121,Same here. Everything about the 7 is so much better than the note 4. Im absolutely gutted.,2016-10-13 08:31:12,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
122,122,Even with two recalls Id argue the note 7 to still be the best phone released this year. Easy.,2016-10-13 09:20:46,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
123,123,Its more a matter of Samsung bricking the device at this point. In my line of work when entering oil terminals they ask to see if I have a Samsung phone regardless of what version it is. Youre better off biting the bullet and downgrading although its just an upgrade because youll actually be allowed to travel with your phone.,2016-10-13 14:44:53,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
124,124,Is there a deadline to receive refunds for the Note 7. I feel like I want to keep it until at least Spring when the new generation of phones come out.,2016-10-13 07:24:00,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
125,125,Im back on my Note 3 too and mourning the loss of my stupid sexy Note 7. My colleague has an S7 Edge that Ive been fondling and its close enough to the Note 7 that Ill temporarily upgrade to one. After that Ill get whatever the next stylus phone is that Samsung releases later next year..,2016-10-12 18:06:03,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User
126,126,Im able to return it for a 100 refund. I had the Note 2 and Note 3 for years with no issue. The only harm I have had from this is the frustration of having to return the phone twice. Im sure that in two years they will have either fixed their issues or completely imploded. Knowing Samsung as a company I will bet that they will have fixed their issues. If you dont feel confident in them to purchase a Samsung product again I completely understand but I have found that outside of this incident their quality has been unsurpassed. Then again maybe the Pixel will win me over.,2016-10-11 16:31:13,[Other]To Samsung From a Note 7 User

137,138,Yeah this is the thing. Im thinking exactly the same now. Fuck. Although OPs answers are pretty vague so its difficult to tell what the actual situation was if theres any chance that it was not plugged in not charging not fresh off a charge and it just randomly exploded in his hand. Then it is a much bigger more scary situation than i had been led to believe...,2016-09-07 04:58:48,I know someone who's note 7 exploded

157,158,Non insurance repair involves replacing the device Are you sure about this. My friend cracked his S7 Edge a few months back and Samsung replaced the screen on his device and gave him back the exact same phone he already had.,2016-11-06 18:17:50,Don't break your S7 edge screen.

162,163,When they repaired my S7E they indicated that the screen and bezel edge frame is one unit.

163,164,They must be real careless. Dropped my S6E a few times already once even from about 1.2m above the ground. No cracks at all only minor dents around the aluminium edges thats hardly noticeable. I dont have a case or screen protector but either way you got to learn how to grip and take care of your phone. Like if I am bringing my phone along for running I make damn well sure that my pants pocket is deep and not shallow otherwise the phone can drop out of the pocket easily.,2016-11-07 11:20:13,Don't break your S7 edge screen.

164,165,S7E is gonna be about 350 400 bucks as somebody in the repair industry unless theyre using knock off non OEM parts.

165,166,exactly...hopefully this really will be a temporary situation...I suspect that they dont actually fix your phone they just replace it with a new one and recycle the components from the old phone into a refurbished one and maybe they are low on S7e with the Note7 mess....I dont know...I just cant believe theyd take this approach...its like they want their stock to crash even further,2016-11-06 10:57:14,Don't break your S7 edge screen.

I know for me Im still hoping for the Note 8. I think the only thing they can do now is taking their time and make sure whatever theyre coming up with next does not have the same faults as the Note 7.

191,192,I get your mad but you are very ignorant. Comparing samsung to Islamic terrorists is retarded. Calling them any sort of terrorist shows you have no idea what that word means and are just saying crap. Yes they rushed the phone but that wasnt the issue. The issue wasnt testing the issue was that one factory fucked up the fail safes for the battery on a very small number of phones. Samsung understanding the severity of the situation issued a recall and several warnings. I dont know what happened with the replacement phones. I dont know why some of them exploded. But samsung didnt plan on it happening. At least they did the smart thing and discontinued it. The phones image was ruined. Nothing could bring it back,2016-10-11 23:11:32,Samsung permanently ends all Galaxy Note7 manufacturing

203,204,Neither of these looks like your Note 4.,2016-08-20 03:31:22,Note 7 next to the S7 Edge.

Not an I disagree so fuck you button. So if you posted this as a parent comment you would be rightfully downvoted. So cry more. Now. If you were posting on a thread about cameras and you were making a point about how a certain camera is better than another then people are just butt hurt over the obvious truth. As an iPhone user probably will be for a long time just for the fact that Im picky and android has too many issues I can wholeheartedly say that Samsungs cameras nowadays are better than those of the iPhones.,2016-08-23 15:47:08,Water bead on leaf shot with S7

255,256,Yes Samsung will be fine. But I dont know about their smartphone division. This could really hurt them big time. Everytime someone flies goes on a train ect they will hear Note7 dangerous for the next year. I could easily see the Galaxy brand be permenantly hurt. At that point Samsung may decide to put less emphasis and investment in the mobile division and concentrate on their chip fab. Samsung may be on the same level as Sony HTC Moto ect and no longer the clear cut 1 Android brand.

271,272,Im giving the iris scanner a break with it being new. Usually those things get pretty buffed out in updates and when new models come out. The fingerprint I would expect to be faster and of course when you have muscle memory to just do it from older phones. I think once you get used to using the scanner it will be more efficient. Like your muscle memory will position it right after a while and you will get used to swiping to unlock that you wont notice it as you do now with how you are just starting to use it. I assume in the next models they will have a more efficient way or even with updates that will make the iris scanner faster to use than to swipe the screen. I think the biggest use of it is being the security behind it. I heard scanning eyes is much harder to work around than fi ngerprints for hackers.,2016-08-18 19:16:35,Hello!

My response was news articles and legit concerns which sprint did not care about... was then told to take it back to where i bought it and hope they had one in... called sprint back... confirmed i have to take it to sams... why the fuck do i have to take it anywhere specific if this is such an issue.. For something that is so dangerous carriers are making this way too difficult.,2016-09-13 07:22:21,Please Return Your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 During The Recall

328,329,Smh ... People dont learn giving money to the same bad company when they are so many better phones out there. iPhones Pixels HTC 10 V20 and lots of great decently priced phones like OP3 Axon 7 etc. When you are buying Galaxy you probably dont care about software so lots of options.,2016-10-13 23:54:52,Reports claim most Note7 customers are opting for an S7 edge replacement.

330,331,No. Be happy that you didnt get to. It makes it that much harder to let go of it. Im switching to the iPhone 7 because its the only phone Verzion has an Annual Upgrade program on so I can hop back the Note 8 in a year and Im so grumpy about losing the Note 7. You dont know what youve got until its gone.,2016-10-13 15:20:09,Reports claim most Note7 customers are opting for an S7 edge replacement.
331,332,After my second note 7 I decided to switch to the 7 edge and if Im being honest I actually wish I got the edge to begin with. Its a work of art and the perfect size and while I miss the s pen I find the edge so much more comfortable to hold and use. I may switch to a pixel xl if they end up coming to ATampT but we shall see.,2016-10-14 00:46:27,Reports claim most Note7 customers are opting for an S7 edge replacement.
332,333,I personally went to the Note 5 for the time being. I had the edge and I felt like the edge was almost too... edgy.,2016-10-13 19:53:51,Reports claim most Note7 customers are opting for an S7 edge replacement.
333,334,You could take it back for a note 5. Its a great phone. Much less lag than the note 7 and I actually prefer the screen. The main thing youll miss is the software features and SD card. One of those may be corrected now.,2016-10-13 20:54:46,Reports claim most Note7 customers are opting for an S7 edge replacement.
334,335,Same boat here. I wont be getting the S7E. I used it as a loaner between N7v1 and N7v2 and I didnt like the edges. Its a fast phone and does great but with the S8 to be announced in Feb Ill be turning in the N7 and waiting. The rumors sound like its going to be a great device.

342,343,That sucks. I usually wait a month or so to get a device. Not this time. I got a note 7 2 days later I get an email from Verizon to tell me about a shipping delay due to battery issues. I waited got it as soon as it was rereleased. Then this crap kept happening. Guess Im opting for an iPhone 7 for now,2016-10-13 13:49:41,Reports claim most Note7 customers are opting for an S7 edge replacement.

344,345,The official recall for the Note 7 is a 100 credit if you get another Samsung phone. I doubt youll see any more than that since the recall is Samsungs fault and not your carriers. Meanwhile your phone will continue to become outdated as all support is dropped.,2016-10-13 16:07:45,Reports claim most Note7 customers are opting for an S7 edge replacement.
345,346,Why would they have a freaking limit on the number of users who could participate on the beta. Isnt more users equal more feedback thus more better software in the end.

355,356,I want to wait for the Pixel but i was loving the Gear VR I got. So I guess im going to have to for the S7 or the S7 Edge if i want to keep using it. Just recently the the Gear VR wont work for the Note 7 anymore Typed from My Grenade,2016-10-10 22:29:05,Samsung officially asking partners to stop sales of Note7
356,357,Doubt theyll ever sell it again.,2016-10-10 23:05:53,Samsung officially asking partners to stop sales of Note7
357,358,Yea essentially Samsung S8 remove the galaxy naming 5.1inch screen no S pen. Based on the S6 Edge chassis. Samsung S8 Pro 5.7inch screen S pen. Based on the Note 7 chassis. I know they insist on 3 flagships this year and 4 last year S7 S7 Edge amp Note 7 for 2016. S6 S6 Edge S6 Edge Plus amp Note 5 for 2015. because they want at least a new flagship phone every 2 financial quarters but at this point they need to revise their strategy to devote all resources to knock the S8 amp S8 Pro out of the park for the entire financial year instead. To me the S6 Edge Plus amp Note 5 are as redundant as the S7 Edge amp Note 7. If the iPhone 7 Plus has to be competed against it would be phones based on the Note 57 chassis not S6 Edge PlusS7 Edge chassis. In my opinion.,2016-10-11 08:44:37,Samsung should name its next phone Samsung Note 6

377,378,congrats. I made the plunge about 4 months ago now or so... It was a constant back and forth for the first few days of hating it and loving it but I LOVE ANDROID.. Apple has made some very bad choices in iOS and phones. So it was inevitable. If you do end up disliking this phone I would recommend the pixel just because it will give you the same feel. But the s7e is such an amazing phone and I love it. DO NOT FORGET TO SET UP AND USE SAMSUNG PAY.,2016-11-08 10:27:45,"Have had an iPhone for the last 6 years. Today, my Galaxy s7 Edge arrived."

504,505,My S8 hopes 1. Dont be afraid to make it slightly thicker for a larger battery. Seriously if companies like Xiaomi can have a 4050mAh battery for their own Note phones that cost much less Samsung should go all out. No one buys phone X because its 0.7mm thinner than phone Y. 2. More reduction of bloatware. I cant stand redundant apps like Camera amp Magnifier. For other apps that hardly people ever use like S Health or Samsung Gear DO NOT pre install them. If they need apps to sync with other devices like the Samsung smartwatch let them download them upon syncing rather than pre installing them. 3. One up Apple further by setting a default 64GB storage. 4. The default apps amp settings visuals should take more cue from the Black Theme darker colors so less battery life is being consumed. Sure consumers can manually change to the all black theme but the average general public are somewhat too dumb for that. I have a handful of relativesfriends who dont know about this 5. Yes dual cameras. nuff said. 6. 4GB RAM and disable the loading animations. You can manually do them in Developer Mode but again how much do the general public know. _____________ Of course all that and VR performance and non exploding batteries would be enough to knock Apple of its spot.,2016-09-09 14:51:31,Hopefully Apple adding stereo speakers in the iPhone 7 forces Samsung to add them to the S8.

514,515,Well the device has to be on in order for current to flow an the issue is something in the phone is heating up too much and causes failure. I assume theres too much current being drawn by the part that fails and either the battery cant handle it or the part gets so hot the battery fails and erupts.,2016-10-10 12:27:43,Samsung temporarily suspends production of Galaxy Note 7
515,516,Probably will be permanent. Theres no 3 strike rule here. I love Samsung products but this wasnt good. If carriers wont even sell them its a death sentence for sure. I have the S7 Edge and its been great. Not sure why this Note 7 has been such a disaster. The Note is usually very renowned because it has the best features of the Galaxy S in a bigger form factor and more refined software. The Note 7 is still that but clearly there was an issue in manufacturing and possibly even engineering in the battery.,2016-10-10 00:31:58,Samsung temporarily suspends production of Galaxy Note 7
516,517,I do have insurance on the phone. I doubt Verizon will warranty this under their 14 day policy though. The phone works fine 100 and the drop really wasnt that bad. There was no damage done to the side trim and the case covers the back now. Ill just wait until something catastrophic happens before putting in a claim at this point.,2016-08-25 10:51:38,Not even a week old... Rear damaged.

525,526,Go to a Verizon company store. Ask the manager if you can do an emergency in store insurance claim. They will call Asurion who will pay the store for the phone after they have collected your deductible. That way you immediately get a brand new phone. If you wait you risk getting a refurbished replacement.,2016-08-26 07:17:04,Not even a week old... Rear damaged.

559,560,1. If they had left a removable battery none of this recall b.s. would be going on. We would all be getting new batteries. 2. They have not released any specific information about what the triggers are for the explosions. 3. All phones that use lithium ion batteries have the potential to explode the other companies have better PR teams than samsung and can keep a lid on it when this happens. 4. The number of phones with issues VS. The number released is ridiculously low statistically it makes no sense to have killed a good phone when they cant even replicate the explosions themselves. Was it something that happened to the phone earlier that day. Was the person using the extra adapter to charge the phone. Was it laying in the sun or near heat in the past 24 hours. There are to many variable for them to do this. The whole thing has been a night mare and those of that have been through the whole debacle twice Will expect them to cough up more the 100.,2016-10-15 15:28:36,Note 7 Debacle to Cost Samsung $3 Billion in Lost Sales

564,565,There are a few things wrong with this. Firstly Im sure they dont make absolutely every phone initially so I dont know maybe 10 million phones.

574,575,Thats my first thought. Weve seen some companies have put mammoth batteries but if theres one thing thats always taken a while to adopt is large storage. 32GB should have been standard many years ago but its only become that since like last year. 8GB and 16GB phones are still common in fact especially on the iPhone. I honestly dont even care about microSD if the internal storage is huge like 128GB or more. Its a faster technology and it rules out errors from a badcheap microSD. one of the thing thats impressive is the water resistance without flaps like the S5. Wonder if they can do the same with the S Pen on the Note 6.,2016-05-04 19:28:13,"Samsung Galaxy Note 6 New Rumors Point To 4200-mAh Battery, 256GB Storage, IP68 Rating And More."

578,579,The S3 has MST which grants it the same functionality as Samsung pay on a normal phone. Some videos around YouTube have also demonstrated it being used on both versions of the S3 so itll be there on launch. Though there is some conflicting information. Somewhere I read that the watch can only handle 5 purchases by itself without being connected to a galaxy phone. Once connected it can do as many as you want and will be reloaded to 5 if the phone is disconnected. Yet their graphic shows that full functionality of Samsung pay is available.

Samsung is supposed to be producing new non explosive N7s right. I wonder if I give it a bit and go the ATampT store if I can exchange it for another N7. Edit Okay so ATampT has revised their statement as follows. Customers with a Note7 may select a Galaxy S7 Galaxy S7 edge Galaxy S7 active Galaxy Note7 or any other smartphone and may also return any Note7 accessories. If a customer chooses another Samsung device he or she will receive a bill credit of 25 per device. Customers will be also able to exchange that interim device for a new Note 7 in the future. That process will be shared as soon as it is available.,2016-09-02 19:46:16,Global Note 7 recall official

Its not burning through your expensive data allowance. 3. Most all. other Samsung phones use it for initial setup. It was an anomaly that the S7 didnt before this. 4.

731,733,Of course its possible. Look at the first version of the Note 7. They pushed out an update that prevented it from charging above 60 percent. Then the Gear VR pushed out an update to prevent the Note 7 from being able to be used in the device. No reason that they cant completely cripple it. Then theres an even easier route... Simply ban all Note 7 IMEIs from carrier networks. In other words blacklist them all just like they would if it was a stolen phone. For liability purposes you would think that at some point they almost have to do that. Somewhere out there you could in theory have someone who doesnt know about a recall. The easiest way to reach that person is to block their phone from the network. Then when they call or go to a store to see the problem they will learn about the recall.,2016-10-15 14:58:54,Samsung Galaxy S8 firmware development already in the works

Went online and confirmed via the MEI number and everything. Weird thing though. The battery power was at 43 when I started the software update. After updating the green battery icon appeared and now my battery life stood at 25. Im betting Samsung just flashed new software in all the replacement units and sent them right back out the door.

854,857,Like you said it is in a demo mode so I cant do everything you can to a regular phone. I will say that menus are the snappier. I honestly am reminded of my old iPhone back when they were king. Ive only had one bad lag issue but that was after forcing the phone to exit the demo video.

855,858,Had a YUUUUGE lag issue after leaving the Note 7 demo video where the phone froze for a solid 5 seconds. But that happens on all other Samsungs demos. So I wouldnt worry about that. I almost forgot the edge was there. Much nicer than the S7E where Id constantly hit the edge. Fits in my hand better too. Lot more natural.,2016-08-06 21:32:46,I have a Note 7 (demo version) in my store. Is there anything you want to know about it?

862,865,Someone told me the sound was better on the Note 7 over the S7 Edge or S7. but you said it is not as loud. Can you double check it.

881,884,I brought back my S6 edge plus the day after I got it because of this. Completely unusable without a case. Gambled and got a S7 Edge after that. It was still a bit annoying. But I could use it with no case just had random letters tossed in my sentences sometimes. Have a note 7 now. Works amazing with no case.

890,893,Absolutely. After recently switching from iOS to Android I love stock Android MUCH more than TouchWiz or Tizen for that matter. I would not get another Samsung.

REALLY cant wait for the new Note.,2016-06-21 09:13:59,If Samsung DITCHED Android Would You Care?
891,894,Yeah I wish I could just get android wear on my gear s but when I look into it its all forum posts of people telling people asking that its stupid because the tizen is allows features like calling but honestly the barren app store stops me from bothering to charge the watch at all at least android wear has 3rd party support...

898,901,Why would you dump Android. I just bought the S7 Edge and Im running as close to stock android as I can. I deleted or disabled as many samsung or 3rd parties apps as I could.

904,907,Anyone here that says Tizen is bad because of the wearable version is really uninformed. Tizen runs in so many Samsung devices and the central point of focus is usually the same advanced tech that is simple for the user and opens doors for mobile that have not been touched yet. Samsung with android is nice but they havent scratched the surface with what they are capable of yet.

932,936,MST wasnt available on the S2 and the addition of it on any Android phone is a huge bonus. Youve just upgraded your phone to pay for stuff on just about any magnetic card reader.,2016-11-15 16:56:00,Samsung Pay Confirmed to work on Gear S3 with any 4.4+ Android Device
933,937,Seems a bit crazy that their brand new product is getting a Black Friday sale.,2016-11-15 14:47:09,Samsung Pay Confirmed to work on Gear S3 with any 4.4+ Android Device
934,938,I would definitely say so yes. I had the S2 since release these new designs and features makes me wanna upgrade. Though its really up to your wrist size,2016-08-31 22:11:59,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic
935,939,The S3 had some minor UI and software tweaks. Will those make their way to the S2 Classic. I have no need for the new features and the S3 is a bit too big i think,2016-09-01 11:16:29,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic
936,940,Theres a beta for the iOS right now as far as the Gear Manager goes. Pretty soon im sure theyll release the final product.,2016-08-31 23:24:25,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic
937,941,Well as far as inbox and hangouts you wont get a separate app available on tizrn you simply get notifications and can reply to them. As far as google now unfortunately the tizen os forces you to use s voice. Its kinda awkward anyways to talk to your watch rather than just your phone. As far as experience difference just expect less app selection for tizen. Its still a good os for the watch though very smooth.,2016-09-01 20:57:08,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic
938,942,Im a big screen person so Im HYPED. I was hoping theyd make AN S2 with a bigger screen but this is even better. As a Nexus 6 owner and now a Note7GS2 owner..... Yessss Plz,2016-09-01 16:04:07,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic
939,943,Tizen honestly isnt bad. Been using my Gear S2 with no problem. Only gripe i have is the lack of variety of apps thats it,2016-09-01 08:26:59,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic
940,944,Ikr. Though the pricing im concerned about since it looks rugged and has sporty features. I hope its not as expensive as the Garmin Fenix 3 which is around 500 or hopefully it doesnt get as expensive as 400,2016-08-31 14:30:13,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic
941,945,Im relieved. I already spent 880 because there was a phone that was slightly better than mine. I didnt want to pony another 350 for a watch. My beloved S2 is safe looking all svelte on my wrist.,2016-08-31 18:57:46,Gear S3 Specs for Frontier and Classic

945,949,Pure marketing and probably a good idea. The S7s are out and appear to be on an annual release cycle now with the Note. The iPhone 7 is likely around the corner. They dont want an uninformed consumer to think that the Note 6 means previous generation.,2016-07-22 16:20:29,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - New Pictures

960,964,If they brought it back with the s7 I dont see why the powerhouse note wouldnt get it back. They knew they messed up taking it away in the first place,2016-06-04 00:52:48,Here's your first look at the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a leaked video and image
961,965,The curved side only makes me love my Note 5 even more. I dont care what hardware is in it if the functionality is decreased. It will make screen protectors impossible to use. Just a stupid decision in my opinion. There are a significant number of people who dont use screen protectors or cases and do just fine.,2016-06-03 16:50:06,Here's your first look at the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a leaked video and image
962,966,Welp looks like Ill be leaving Samsung by the time I can upgrade from the S6. I was planning on hoping with the next note but Im not a fan of the edge display at all. And judging by the way theyre going the S series is likely to not have a non edge device by the 8th generation.,2016-06-03 20:03:59,Here's your first look at the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a leaked video and image

964,968,Looks pretty cool. Was hoping for an edge variant but I wont mind the curves since I already have the s7e. But dat alleged 4200 mAh battery doe. Will definatly be the biggest battery phone I ever had.,2016-06-04 13:43:21,Here's your first look at the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a leaked video and image

970,974,Having the s7 edge I wouldnt want that double edge on a bigger phone. The curved portion is quite sensitive and I imagine the stretch to reach on a bigger screen will lead to more accidental inputs.,2016-06-03 16:49:32,Here's your first look at the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a leaked video and image
971,975,IR blaster..,2016-06-03 10:19:07,Here's your first look at the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a leaked video and image
972,976,The only reason Im not hating Samsung after owning my Note 4 is because it has replaceable battery. There is no way I trust a Samsung phone without one. Ill keep the Note 4 for another year. I dont see much upgrades in the new phones.,2016-06-04 13:23:45,Here's your first look at the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a leaked video and image

A TSA spokesperson we spoke to said that TSA agents would not be searching for their phones specifically but if ampquotThey encounter one at a checkpoint they would inform the owner that the phone is not allowed on the aircraft and direct the passenger to leave the checkpoint and come back without the phone.ampquot If a Note 7 phone is discovered in checked baggage TSA will turn it over to the airline. ampquotSamsung together with carriers is working to communicate the U.S. Department of Transportation new order to ban all Galaxy Note7 devices in carry on and checked baggage on flightsampquot said a Samsung representative in an emailed statement to The Verge.

1049,1053,I jiffd last night. It was amazing.,2016-08-03 12:11:09,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On
1050,1054,Like with most if not all phones anything is possible. It may not happen quickly but it will assuredly happen eventually.,2016-08-02 13:51:37,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On
1051,1055,Excellent pre review,2016-08-02 12:07:21,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On
1052,1056,Yes and now of the much cheaper new phones are coming up with 6 GB ram. But Samsung is starting to pull a Apple to some extent. The Samsung of old refused to be out speced The new Samsung S6 onwards seems to focus on UX and refining of hardware and software. Samsung still has very good specs but they dont seem to throw in stuff just for the specs it seems. The old Samsung would have produced a Note 7 that had 4000 4500 mah battery snapdragon 821 20 mp camera 6 GB Ram etc but with horrible UI that lags ugly looking hardware etc.,2016-08-02 12:59:44,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On
1053,1057,None the less it may be similar to the S7 Well Most notes have been similar to their counterpart in the S series it seems like. Either way Wasnt a fan of the S6 Freezes to much I miss my Note 3 and the stylist Hope this model is much better Great for movie watching while in the field.,2016-08-03 10:51:10,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On
1054,1058,I used to treat my Note pen as a stylus. Then when I figured out the other functions and used them better its like the song in Aladin A Whole New World was singing in my head. My Note using lifestyle has never been the same since that moment. Love the Note.,2016-08-01 20:15:55,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1055,1059,Dont discount the iris scanner. Gimmicky for average Joe consumer... But in the enterprise and byod space... Could be game changer.,2016-07-31 21:59:29,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1056,1060,Still salty.,2016-08-01 19:02:21,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1057,1061,I plan on using the fingerprint reader 99 of the time but the iris scanner will come in handy in the winter when youre wearing gloves. Even if it takes a second or two longer to hold up to your face to unlock thats still much fastermore convenient than taking your gloves off. Im also dying to start using the S Pen. Ive never had a Note before but the more I read about the S Pen the more it seems incredibly usefulconvenient. Sure I was hoping for a 4200mah or 4000mah battery as the earlier leaks indicated or even 3600 for that matter but 3500mah will still be the biggest battery Ive ever had in a phone coming from an S5 and is still an upgrade from the Note 5 which is really what it should be getting compared to. 2.8 smaller than the S7E doesnt seem like a dealbreaker to me anymore. And lets all remember these are all rumors. Well know some cold hard facts in the morning.,2016-08-02 00:51:40,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1058,1062,So I dont want to be complaining about everything thats possible to complain about. The Galaxy Note 7 seems like an amazing phone.... As the Galaxy S7 was But am I the only one really deceived and unimpressed that they release it with cpu snapdragon 820 at this time for america. Like.... all phones since beginning of year have that CPU and some phones from smaller companies are already announced with Snapdragon 821Higher clockrate and latest version to be released in August.... So except if I got this wrong and that its indeed the snapdragon 821 or that theres a way here in Canada to get the Exynos version I think Imma just wait and grab the next Nexus instead.... What are your thoughts on this.,2016-08-02 12:54:00,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1059,1063,The s pen is huge. I was able to use a demo note at verizon for about a half hour the other day and am sold for that reason. Being able to annotate things and all of the functionality it has is very useful even for the short time I had used it. Sold on the note I am now an ex iPhone user...,2016-08-01 20:02:51,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1060,1064,Why is that Note specific.,2016-07-31 22:12:42,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1061,1065,This phone will be 5 months older than the S7S7E with virtually identical specs Im confused why you said this the Note7 is coming out five months after the S7... .,2016-08-17 14:57:02,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1062,1066,Im in the minority with you. I hate the stylus entirely. I just dont need or care about it. Its wasting space inside my phone. I only get the note for the size. If theyd make an S8 large I wouldnt need to buy note anymore. Considering the Note 7 edge display I have to pray for S8 large edition I guess.,2016-08-01 23:49:34,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1063,1067,Rumors are rumors. Wait 2 days before judging when we have concrete facts,2016-07-31 21:02:13,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1064,1068,Then its not for you. The spen isnt gimmicky its actually really useful. I used the shit out of mine when I had the note 2 and note 3. I jumped from the Note 3 to the S6 Active and miss the crap out of it. Cant say 100 until they officially launch and release specs but I think Im sold on it. The biggest drawback is no IR blaster.,2016-08-01 08:30:16,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1065,1069,The Note 4 finger print scanner was a gimmick. They fixed it after that with the S6 and the Note 5 works just as good as the iPhone.,2016-08-02 13:37:23,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1066,1070,Wireless charging though... I literally never plug my s7e in,2016-07-31 23:48:26,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1067,1071,What do you know about its specs. can you put the S pen in backwards. lol,2016-07-31 23:42:50,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1068,1072,I have heard so many rumors. Why do you think those ones are true.,2016-08-01 04:22:08,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1069,1073,Im going to bet that there will be a base and superpowered version. One with 4 and 3500 and s7e stuff and one with 6 4000 and really powerful specs so like one could be for power users and one could be for productivity because they just want the s pen,2016-07-31 21:46:13,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1070,1074,I currently have the S7 Edge and that pen on the Note 7 makes me wet man.,2016-09-21 16:25:23,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1071,1075,I guess Ill skip the note 7.,2016-07-31 23:40:41,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1072,1076,Best Buy has not seen them. I have a sign for pre orders and nothing more.,2016-07-31 22:03:13,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1073,1077,Absolutely this. People that are looking at this as just a phone miss the point of the Note series entirely. The Note phones have no real competition to users that have adopted the S Pen.,2016-08-01 18:52:14,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1074,1078,no one has said how much faster fast charging is. Its that what makes a real difference.,2016-08-01 06:49:21,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"

1341,1348,This is because USB C cables are reversible. EDIT The ridges are to help identify which side of the USB cable is up so that you can essentially plug in the micro USB cable into your phone without much effort. As USB C cables can go in either way the design of the ridges are no longer needed. Would look pretty weird with ridges on both sides and having it on one side would habituate people into plugging in USB C cables only one way.,2016-07-18 09:55:25,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to employ a Type-C USB port
1342,1349,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you _may_ have the USB 3 speeds. On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere. And none of those will work on the new phone. However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new. Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C. Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier.,2016-07-18 02:38:14,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to employ a Type-C USB port

But if they fail to update the ware on my S2 I am going to think twice.,2016-08-20 13:52:49,Samsung's Gear S3 smartwatch should be coming this month

1486,1494,I mean if you buy a device on a payment plan it means that you have to buy the device entirely and not get a discount on it. Meanwhile if you sign a 2 year contract I can get 550 off on the device for agreeing to stay with the carrier for 2 years. Since the device payment plan breaks it down over 24 months anyways isnt it beneficial to buy it under a 2 year contract. I honestly dont care if I get locked down for two years. unless hidden fees apply Also I do know that T mobile has more perks but they dont have 2 year contracts. According to my logic above wouldnt it be beneficial to stay with VZW. Also my parents are with Verizon so we can get the 4 lines for 150 deal which is actually pretty sweet. My parents just hate the idea of having to leave a carrier theyve been with for 10 years.,2016-08-14 16:06:25,S7 Edge or Note 7?

1488,1496,I would do the Note in all honesty. Its still an amazing phone. However I have to wait til September to get mine. I have a striking feeling they may come up with a more advanced version with how they are currently in other countries. So the wait may be worth it but you need it now. If I were you I would figure out what I want and what the most important things are in a phone you want. Then check off any pros and cons with each version until you settle with what has the better features for you. I feel the Note 7 will offer more especially with the extra features it has. Plus if you make a habit out of using the pen you may grow addicted to using it. I forced myself to use it after not using it for a year. That whole year I feel like I missed out on its full potential and ever since I have never gone a day without using the pen. Its incredibly useful for what I do and I dont think I could be any more efficient with an S series phone than the Notes. Especially with how much they expanded on the pen features I am excited to get the N7.,2016-08-14 08:30:37,S7 Edge or Note 7?

1600,1609,I rock the OnePlus 3...the phone is fantastic. Downsides are that it only works on T Mobile and ATT in US and the customer service from OnePlus leaves a lot to be desired.

1616,1625,Dear friends. After totally refusal all my requests i am heartly ask to help me. Please resent my letter to Samsung Camera plant or Samsung Quality Division. 07.14.2015 in the city of Minsk Belarus I bought a cell phone Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro K920 IMEI 864784020604256. After 2 months of use camera is a defect. When poor light on the photographs appear blue dots. Its very bad for me. I enclose a photo examples. I guess it is a manufacturing defect photo module Samsung Isocell I ask you to assist in the elimination of this defect. In Belarus this photo module replacement is not provided. Seller and warranty shop in Belarus now ceased operations. Russian and many other states Samsung supportChineseLenovo and China Mobile supports are rejected my request. I ask you to help me with that problem. With best regards,2016-09-08 14:09:18,Samsung's customer support is amazing
1617,1626,I had a totally different experience. Their customer service is really bad. My S6 straight up burns me and has recently stopped working at a very inconvenient time when I dont really have the money to replace it. I sent them an e mail detailing my long list of issues with my phone and I got a form response from a dude in India basically telling me too bad you bought your phone over a year ago. I would like to thank you for continuously selecting Samsung branded products for your daily needs. You are truly one of the most loyal cusotmer of our company and it has always been a sheer pleasure to serve you. The whole letter read like a parody of customer service. Sheer pleasure of serving me. When my phone burns me and youre telling me Im SOL. Also the link to the are you satisfied survey naturally does not work in the e mail and there was no response. This whole thing has left me so jaded and depressed. Really really bad customer service. As another user pointed out this will probably be the last Samsung product I buy in a while. I literally dont want to support them anymore. I wanted them to be the droid alternative to Apple but Im going to have to keep searching.,2016-09-08 19:34:33,Samsung's customer support is amazing

1664,1673,It looks like the design might be taking a Note 5S6 approach where the flat side of the phone is opposite between the two. That being said I cant say the thin frame all around the phone has much appeal. I like the previous design where it stays thin on the sides and larger on the top and bottom. Gives the curved glass side a nicer look instead of the bubble.

1808,1817,From where did you purchase the phone itself. On the link it appears as though and I may be entirely wrong so forgive me Samsung is refunding the accessories. When I return my Note 7 to Verizon I intend on bringing the receipts for accessories that I purchased at Best Buy to see if this is indeed the case. It may not be but it makes sense for Samsung to bear the burden of refunding accessories. Edit an earlier iteration of this link mentioned accessories.

It fell half a foot. Now I never had a case so I am not removing my responsibility but I drop my Galaxy S5 all the time sometimes majestically and it didnt break before or now.

I dont know what to do . Should I just buy a screen protector and put it on. Because the crack is small and bare seeable .,2016-08-21 08:17:30,Possibly the first person to crack the note 7 screen?
1828,1837,If you cant do without or think you want all the new s pen features I say its worth it. Otherwise if you dont need a stylus go without.,2016-08-07 22:09:02,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1829,1838,Does anyone know if the note 7 will have the same cooling as the s7 and s7 edge. Im thinking about getting it but I dont want to have overheating issues like the s6 since I do plan on getting the gear vr with it.,2016-08-09 21:01:35,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1830,1839,There is nothing the S7 Edge can do that the Note 7 couldnt. The Note 7 is pretty much a slightly bigger slightly improved and slightly more refined S7 Edge with an S Pen. The difference is really only about 100 and not 200 like you stated talking about new. Its really a question of if you use S Pen or not. There just isnt enough differentiating feature and I wouldnt even say the price is that big of a difference between the 2 phones.,2016-08-07 22:54:40,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1831,1840,At least in the US the official unlocked version is 779 and Note 7 is 850 which is what the US unlocked version of Note 7 will cost once it releases in couple of months. What S7 edge costs 650. Are you talking about the international unlocked models without warranty. Samsung pay dont work etc. So its definitely worth 70 to 100 actual price difference.,2016-08-07 21:49:58,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1832,1841,If you would utilize full use out of the pen yes. Plus it still has some features the S7 doesnt have. I heard the sound quality is improved thats a mouth to ear thing though. My justification of getting it is that I heavily used the pen. It was great at writing quick notes easy place to have a quick screen grab and I just always used it for a multitude of things. I didnt use it a lot early on but I spent time with it and made it a habit to use and I realized that the s pen is much more than a regular stylus. It is a proper functionality feature that has a hell lot of potential for the Note.,2016-08-07 21:32:24,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1833,1842,Preordered yesterday. Feel in hand is second to none for me. Got my 6p on Swappa.,2016-08-08 03:13:49,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1834,1843,I wouldnt say so. More rigid build due to higher quality aluminum Gorilla Glass 5 Improved screen 50 brighter at max HDR compatibility Vastly improved UX S Pen Iris scanner a gimmick for most people USB C USB 3.1 Slightly larger screen and dimensions 100mAh smaller battery Less curved display Significantly better in hand feel,2016-08-07 23:01:11,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1835,1844,Is a s pen worth 200 to you,2016-08-08 09:59:17,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1836,1845,It depends on your use case. The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen has the iris scanner as a security option and of course the greatly improved S Pen and the more fine tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later. If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it get the Note. If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge. Theyre both great phones it just depends on what feel is the most important part some more features or saving money.,2016-08-07 20:48:14,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1837,1846,Whats the difference between GG4 and GG5.,2016-08-08 07:44:07,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1838,1847,If you want the S Pen then there are enough other small improvements to make it worth the price. However if you dont like the S Pen then I dont think those small improvements are enough to justify 100 200 by themselves.,2016-08-08 09:28:08,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1839,1848,Its not an easy decidion. Nonetheless do you prefer bigger phones. Would you use the stylus.,2016-08-07 20:47:43,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?
1840,1849,Easily worth the extra 200. Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you cannot get to the finger print scanner USB 3.1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features. I would pay more for anyone of those but to add them all together is a bargain for 200.,2016-08-08 18:51:34,Is the Note 7 worth the $200 over the S7 edge?

1905,1914,Im sorry that you had this experience with T Mobile. With rates that cheap they have to cut corners somewhere right.

1906,1915,T Mobile locations are absolute shit. The T Mobile phone supervisors are the absolute best. If you ever have a huge problem like this speak directly to a supervisor and explain what theyre doing wrong. Ive had a supervisor give us a 200 credit in the past. You ended up getting free phones somehow because the supervisors are the only ones that get stuff done.,2016-09-14 18:20:18,Note 7 T-Mobile Experience and Exchange [Rant]
1907,1916,ATampT user here and I had the same experience. Literally walked into my store returned the phone and that was it... Maybe were lucky. I dont know but that was a painless 5 minute return for me and it seems like on Reddit theres another person every day with issues of exchange or return on a worldwide recall. Granted I didnt have to do an exchange as I have a backup phone but I cant imagine its significantly more difficult. I guess the big issue here is if you can wait for the note 7 replacement or not. I personally will be fine without the note 7 for a few more weeks as Im not going to die without it which seems to be the case for most people online.,2016-09-15 07:32:02,Note 7 T-Mobile Experience and Exchange [Rant]
1908,1917,Im sorry you had such a sour experience I just moved back to t mobile after a miserable time with VZW.

1911,1920,I decided to phone an exchange in and do the transferbackup myself. I made sure to ask about how the temporary exchange would work. Waiting on the phone in the mail. IMHO its far easier than dealing with a person trying to do it in store regardless of carrier or store. I did go in store initially but he actually talked me out of exchanging it. Weird.,2016-09-14 23:11:02,Note 7 T-Mobile Experience and Exchange [Rant]
1912,1921,My SO and I are having the same problems with t mobile. Gotta be sure your dealing with a Corp owned store. My first problem was going into a t mobile independently owned store. They are the absolute worst in service and complete assholes. Ive been calling t mobile over 9 times my boyfriend has 3 times. We went to one location the shitty one then the good store. It took over 3 hours for the two stores and we were almost late for work. We now have loaner phones we had to pay taxes for and yesterday a t mobile phone support was going to call me back to order our new phones the iPhone 7 plus. Our bill is over 700. Were stuck with free tablets because the shitty store pressured us to get them. Then after signing the papers he tells us theres a 75 restocking fee for each tablet. Loyalty dept wont take back the free tablets cause their not technically accessories but they are since you cant get them without ordering a note 7. And our note 7s could have blow out our eyes cause the phone got fucking hot using it with a gear vr. I dont know what to do anymore. Its been so stressful with everything. Now Im afraid these s7 loaners are somehow gonna be our upgrades and we wont get the actual phone we want. Weve been with t mobile for 4 yrs. Were thinking of selling everything that has a line phones tablets smart watch ue boom and ipad and buying I phones through apple instead. Im so tired of t mobile so called support. They dont do shit but placate you or like in the store you got associate yelling at another coworker on the phone. Its a shot show and its not totally t mobile fault but it is. And its also Samsung fault too. They made a battery that has created over 2 million people that have lost their shit on people just doing their job or in some cases they employees aint doing nothing to help.

In the 2 years I had my 5s the entire phone held up like a champ. I never once replaced the screen or phone. My concern with the note 7 was the edge style screen.

1942,1951,One thing Ive seen Asurion do is get a lot more streamlined. I originally had a 2014 Moto X but the screen cracked. They sent me an S5 as they had no Moto Xs in stock. A couple months later Im at work using my phone and put it down to take a call on the landline. While on the call the screen shut off like normal to save power. After the call I picked my S5 back up but the screen wouldnt turn on. I tried everything. Battery restart etc and nothing was working but the phone would still vibrate that indicates it was accepting input. Called up Asurion and told them their replacement device they sent me stopped working for absolutely no reason and they having no S5 or Moto Xs in stock sent me a nice new gold S6. A couple of years ago it felt like Id be on the phone with Asurion for 2 hours but recently it seems like a 20 minute call at most is all I need to make.,2016-08-05 08:06:23,Avoid Samsung Protection Plus
1943,1952,All I had to do to submit my claim is go to their website sppmobileclaims.com and submit a claim using the phone number that I gave them when I bought protection plus. They called me next day to confirm what I said on the claim. The second claim went really wrong though because they sent me a letter saying they never received my old device so they were going to charge me 400. I called them at the official number they have on their website and the rep. Just said I have to call USPS and give them the tracking number and say it was never delivered and USPS will give me a claim number and to just give that to an spp rep. and I wouldnt have to pay anything. They connect you to an actual person when you call the number really quickly and they are good at what they do Id rate them up there with Amazons customer service. Im thinking you were calling the wrong number and were talking to insurance for T Mobile or any other cellular provider that also deals with them and not Samsung protection plus which use the same insurance company. This is their correct number you call it or visit the website I mentioned earlier only those will put you in direct contact with their spp department and not their other departments.,2016-08-04 17:01:17,Avoid Samsung Protection Plus

But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October. Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7.

1986,1995,I am with U.S. Cellular they are the only coverage in my rural area and they have a pretty limited phone selection. They dont sell the Moto phones anymore which would be my second choice.,2016-09-17 12:20:42,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?

1989,1998,I switched from a 6s to an S7 love it. High quality phone for sure. The screen is glorious....gorilla glass too,2016-09-17 09:02:43,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?
1990,1999,I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7 having to return it under the recall. I really never got used to the edge thing and battery life was not near even my 2 year old 6 but it was OK. I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time. Battery life is also kinda short depending on what the phone is doing but it feels like less than the 6 most of the time. I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation. I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair. Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones. Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor. Nirvana to me would be Android OS on an iPhone. For now Im going back to iPhone not because Im in love with the OS or the customer hostile attitude but just because I feel like I can have the thing for years and know that it wont explode or shatter or mysteriously die without it at least being under a better warranty than mail it in and wait 2 weeks while we find a way to blame you. Assuming youre not concerned about the build quality then the S7 is a fine phone. Its bigger than the non plusses and large enough that I can still fat finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it. If you can overlook the neon glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing Ive seen especially at night when the black screen background is... black. And being able to get content on and off of it without iTunes cancer is miraculous in and of itself. Chrome on Android kills Safari even on IOS 10 IMO. I dont think youd be missing anything going to the S7 if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem. As long as it doesnt explode or shatter. Also... compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster... most of the time there is no waiting for things to load but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device.,2016-09-16 20:11:24,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?
1991,2000,I am in the same bloody boat. Currently using Note5 wanted to get a Note7 when it came out but then the phones were recalled and whole exploding battery fiasco thing kind of scared me. Decided to go for an iPhone7 but seeing the reviews and even the speed tests I am not sure it is worth the money and I am back to block 1. Should I get the Note7 when it launches with safe batteries get an S7 Edge or wait for an S8. So fucking torn between these three choices,2016-09-17 09:34:45,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?
1992,2001,If only it wasnt ATampT exclusive. Id consider it if there was an unlocked International version.,2016-09-16 21:00:58,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?

1995,2004,Oh man im also torn at the moment. Im using an iPhone 6 right now and have been doing since it was released and im happy with the phone but im kind of tired with Apple locking everything down. iPhone 7 is just Apple helping me with the decision to switch over. Im sure i would be really happy with the S7 but im also afraid that ill regret not waiting for the S8 when its released.,2016-09-17 06:18:07,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?
1996,2005,Its risky because they can stop paying their phone plan and you end up with a blacklisted phone.,2016-09-16 22:34:47,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?
1997,2006,I recently came from an iPhone 6 to an S7 Edge. It is an amazing phone and Im not worried about newer phones like the S8 coming out. This is because there isnt really anything that this phone is missing. It has a bloody massive battery great screen micro SD card support IP68 water resistance etc. The S8 will most likely have the new iris scanner but honestly a finger print scanner is more practical and probably faster. What Im saying is that the S7 difference from an S8 wont be that big especially when you previously used an iPhone.,2016-09-16 19:49:24,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?
1998,2007,19th September or October. I was told Id get mine carphone warehouse too 2nd October.,2016-09-15 15:29:18,I wish they would just give a date on when they will be available again so I would know what to do.
1999,2008,Same. Not giving up my phone unless there is like a super ridiculous time frame like January 2017. Especially not going to iPhone again because I just got done transferring everything over it seems like. Hopefully the early October like they said is the later date.,2016-09-14 22:21:15,I wish they would just give a date on when they will be available again so I would know what to do.
2000,2009,I prefer USB C. Coming from iPhone I cant imagine having to actually look and see which way the cord goes in each time. Sounds archaic. Not to mention the 64gb internal which is important for us folks who keep all our porn in Secure Folder which doesnt allow storing on the SD card. Also the screen is brighter AND dimmer.,2016-09-14 19:15:28,I wish they would just give a date on when they will be available again so I would know what to do.
2001,2010,I had something similar happen to me. I had a Note 4 which was a great phone. But the motherboard started to go out. Its resetting itself and freezing and now is stuck in a constant reboot loop. I argued with Sprint for 4 DAYS over them getting me out of my contract and selling me the phone with their new contract price because I didnt want to spend 850 on it. I finally got them to agree to drop my contract and start a new one so I can get the phone. I put in an order for 2 of them one for me and one for my wife. Then I wake up the next day and the phone has been recalled. Never even shipped it to me. Now my Note 4 is 100 dead and Im using my wifes old S5.,2016-09-14 21:46:12,I wish they would just give a date on when they will be available again so I would know what to do.
2002,2011,Do you still have your note or have you traded it in.,2016-09-15 10:03:06,I wish they would just give a date on when they will be available again so I would know what to do.
2003,2012,Samsung pinpointed the issue and resolved it a good while ago now. And replacement units were shipped out to stores. However folks demanded the government step in with an official recall. Rather than waiting even longer for that Samsung consulted with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Now youre all waiting for word from the CPSC before the phones can actually be released. The original timetable had exchange units in stores by today or Friday. Now its out of Samsungs hands.,2016-09-14 16:43:51,I wish they would just give a date on when they will be available again so I would know what to do.
2004,2013,I stopped by best buy today just for curiosity and was told the replacement shipments were shipped out Monday. Whether or not that was factual I have no way of verifying...but I also did not purchase my phone there employee account so he really had no incentive to lie to me.,2016-09-14 13:47:28,I wish they would just give a date on when they will be available again so I would know what to do.

2007,2016,Upvote for the humor. I had a good laugh. I went from Samsung keyboard to Swiftkey...now I use Google keyboard. You can type a word then select it in the recommendation bar up top to add it to memory. Alas I can cuss all day long without spell check.,2016-08-31 11:37:03,The latest Android update on my Note 4 is censoring me and it's starting to kiss me the duck off.
2008,2017,When comparing with the iPhone 5 keyboard and autocorrect which I owned and used for around a year before I purchased a Samsung S6 Edge have now had for a year also I found the autocorrect for the iPhone was far nicer. At first I put it down to just getting used to the new phones nuances but since then Ive realised I did just find typing a text less cumbersome on the iPhone. I frequently have to delete the autocorrection because the phone didnt recognise the word refill out the edited part then hit space only to have it autocorrect again. I dont know exactly why but this I think has been one of the bigger issues Ive had with switching that just hasnt settled in every other difference is now just normal and I struggle to remember how to navigate an iPhone.,2016-09-01 07:00:49,The latest Android update on my Note 4 is censoring me and it's starting to kiss me the duck off.
2009,2018,Not sure why youd want to drop so far down in performance but to each their own I suppose.,2016-08-23 15:52:34,Switching from Iphone 6s to Note 7
2010,2019,My Note 4 was great and aged amazing. The only drawback was battery it would reach a certain point and then jump to very low numbers. Like it would go to 20 or 24 and drop to either 0 or 8. Could be the battery or I could have damaged something with leaving it someplace hot because that seems to be the case with battery issues Ive seen.,2016-08-23 11:52:33,Switching from Iphone 6s to Note 7
2011,2020,This... I had iPhone4 then sgs3 now sgs5 and thinking of what to switch to next. I miss the smoothness of iPhone but keep remembering that end of 2 years of iPhone4 when I was so tired of the phone. With my sgs5 I can throw on a new launcher or get rid of all my old widgets and install new ones to tide me over till more options come out.,2016-08-23 09:39:56,Switching from Iphone 6s to Note 7
2012,2021,I see the whole IOS is optimized for the hardware argument being thrown around a lot. I left IOS because the updates slowed my iPhone down to the point where it was almost unusable. Gotta love that optimization. Ive been using a Note 5 since the end of last year. The phone has gotten faster with updates particularly MM. The software experience is actually really good and its highly customisable. The hardware is the selling point for these phones. You get the best phone screen on the market. Period. Awesome battery life. An amazing camera. Wireless charging. Premium build quality. Expandable storage. Waterproofing. Samsung pay works in more places. Anything prior to the Note 4 is going to give a less than stellar representation of the Samsung experience as prior to that It honestly was a bad experience. Samsung have taken their game to the next level with their recent phones especially the S7 series.,2016-08-23 06:36:42,Switching from Iphone 6s to Note 7

2014,2023,I am amazed about how the headphone jack wont make you buy the iphone 7. You still didnt see what apple has to say about this. it might be because the phone became waterproof so the headphone jack could be replaced with different earphones. Dont be so negative before the iphone 7s release,2016-08-23 10:56:28,Switching from Iphone 6s to Note 7
2015,2024,Having owned Samsungs since the first galaxy I can tell you that Ive only had issues with one and that was the s3 and that was my fault. I dropped it 3 times not in a row down iron bark stairs. After a while it just stopped working. This was around the time the s5 came out and I bought an s5 not long after. Ive now moved onto the s7 edge but my s5 is onto a new owner and still working fine. Owning a samsung is like owning a desktop. You have to care for it delete old shit watch out for nasty surprises and keep the skin flicks to a minimum.,2016-08-23 07:36:09,Switching from Iphone 6s to Note 7

2018,2027,Im moving on from my 6s plus to a note 7. That screen and camera and no bezels got me Ill navigate android just fine I think. Plus I need to break free of the apple ecosystem now or I never will. IMO the note 7 is everything the iPhone plus should be but instead we just got an iPhone with a bigger screen thats all. Ive been using iOS 10 since the first public beta and right now on the 6th its pretty much solid and smooth and it does nothing of any significance for me,2016-08-23 11:32:17,Switching from Iphone 6s to Note 7

2024,2033,I really hope this is not true because being stuck on the May patch while the carrier versions are on July if Im not mistaken is kind of discouraging. I will probably sell this if this is the case and go iPhone Nexus or Note 7. Part of the reason why I bought this was because I assumed itd get updates without carrier interference but I could be mistaken. Time will tell but as of right now Im still happy with it.,2016-08-01 23:18:13,"[Trust no one] Samsung's Twitter support reps are telling people the unlocked US Galaxy S7 won't get updates, but that's completely wrong."

2027,2036,I took it to the Samsung repair centre and they would have fixed it if my warranty was still valid but there was a little crack in the back so they quoted me for it.

2077,2086,I have the S7 Edge since its launching day. Works like a charm and by far the best phone Ive ever used minus the Note 7 which I have used for few weeks before having to return it.

2103,2112,Woke up and took it off the charger. Are you charging over night with the fast charger. That could be a large part of your problem right there. A lot of android phones dont automatically stop charging at 100 especially if they are fast charging. You may have overcharged your battery.,2016-09-29 20:34:04,"Galaxy S6 Edge acting up, what to do?"
2104,2113,Ive also just started experience an extreme battery drain on my Galaxy S6 Edge today. Really not sure what the issue is. Battery seems to be reporting a heavy use of Google Services but Im curious if it has anything to do with the recent update that came out a few days ago. Im on Verizon. Its reached 20 twice today so far and Im barely using it. It usually lasts through the workday at about 60 but its nowhere near that today. Its also noticeably more hot to the touch today. Battery seems to be in overdrive for whatever reason. Restarting the phone didnt help either.,2016-09-29 16:46:49,"Galaxy S6 Edge acting up, what to do?"

2108,2117,It could be this it was happening to me this morning. Uninstalling the Oculus app fixed it immediately,2016-09-30 01:37:00,"S7 Overheating, is it gonna blow??"
2109,2118,You could try this If youre experiencing overheating even when not using or charging your phone it could be down to a particular app. Luckily the Battery optimiser setting allows you to stop apps from sapping energy when the phone isnt in use. Go to Settings Battery Battery Usage More Optimise battery usage and tap All Apps. Doing this will stop apps from working in the background even when youre not using the phone. If overheating persists you can try wiping the cache partition. With your Galaxy S7 turned off press and hold the Power Home and Volume Up buttons together until you see the Samsung logo and then release. This launches the S7 s Android system recovery mode. Tap the Volume Down button to scroll down the list of options and then select Cache Partition by pressing the Power button. If all else fails a factory reset might be in order. If that proves unsuccessful its time to return the S7 to Samsung for a replacement.,2016-09-29 17:13:31,"S7 Overheating, is it gonna blow??"

2111,2120,My Galaxy S7 Edge did indeed overheat using the charger that came with the unit the adaptive fast charger. My wifes unit also gets hot to the touch while charging. As a result of my unit overheating it discolored and pitted the area around the Home Button very close to the charger connection. I was given a reference number then received an email that my complaint was without merit. I offered to send a pic while on chat and she said okay but never asked further. Nowwith the bs update I have a two 600 useless paperweights. I am pissed.,2016-10-01 02:08:39,"S7 Overheating, is it gonna blow??"
2112,2121,It looks like the phone was put on a hotplate. The battery hasnt vented so thats not what caused it. And it only seems to be melted around the edges those in which would be the first to touch a hot plate or frying pan on an oven. I say this because the CPU which is what generates the most heat in the device is located in the center by the camera not the outer edges of the phone. I think someone just tried to pull a fast one to get their phone replaced on you.,2016-09-30 12:38:28,"S7 Overheating, is it gonna blow??"

2169,2178,I keep hearing all these claims of from what Ive seen and mine has scratches and all I did is put it in my pocket and I believed the hype and have gotten more paranoid. But Ive seen little picture evidence to support the claims. Outside of display models the JRE video and a couple random pics on the net where are all the pics... Ive also heard multiple reports of no scratches from everyday commuters to construction workers but like all things the negatives seem to get the most attention. Ive had mine since day one with a case covering the back and naked on the front. Ive been careful probably over protective and I have no scratches... Yet....

2268,2278,I mentiond this in another thread about the same issue. Samsung pay was one of the things they advertised with the Gear S2. They also advertised MapMyRun intergration as a premier partner. So I bought the watch. Then I learned that they lied about Samsung Pay as it wasnt actually available for the watch. Then I learned that MapMyRun actually wasnt available either with no plans of ever actually making it available in the future.

2309,2319,The practical application is when you go to show someone a photo and it takes 27 seconds to wake up the device and open Gallery. Then when you go to scroll through all your photos there is a delay. While I dont think this is going to be the same level problem as I had with my S6 Active on Lollipop I still think it is important to let the manufacturer know that it is something that should be addressed as if they dont already know.,2016-08-12 00:39:38,Note 7 has poor rAM managment as well..
2310,2320,While it would be nice for it to have the memory to go back to where it left off this doesnt put me off of getting Note. I have tried a Note and iPhone and given both a try Note 7 please. I just cant do iPhone I dont like the ios or anything really. Not my cup of tea. Plus the Note 7 has much more use behind it than the hardware I have found.

2312,2322,So your saying a program that is written to benchmark Apple products doesnt properly benchmark a Samsung product. Go ahead and try to argue the whole IOS and Android app thing and youll be wrong because Apple holds everything from its hardware to the software that it runs on. Samsung makes the hardware and then adds its own flavor to the software that Google maintains. Completely different it isnt an Apples to Apples comparison. Try comparing it to another Android phone instead youd be allot closer. Dang 8 years and we are still having this argument.,2016-08-12 00:34:18,Note 7 has poor rAM managment as well..

2315,2325,Cant be worse than the note 5...if not Ill take the storage expansion and bad ram management over my note 5 all day. My phone isnt my overclocking gaming rig and benchmarking my phone is not important to me. I dont need it to render video or run over clocked for 8 hours on aida64 or prime 95 with ihigh temperatures. Some people really buy phones for reasons other than calling and media. Like more important reasons like benchmarking. Need to make a sub for that.

2381,2392,Yeah going from a 6s to an s7 edge then to note 7 it wasnt amazingly different. I think the only reason I would tell you to get the s7 edge is if you were inexperienced with android but you had it before so no point.

2394,2405,They may have something like that on their minds ... Too bad that in europe there is no new phones for replacement so im still without my new phone even though ive sent the defective one 12th of september and today is 21th but theres still no new info of whey they will send the devices. They publicated the 19th of september as a start of exchange process but NOBODY in poland or germany got a new phone since then ... I have enough of these korean bastards im starting to think maybe north is the good side and the south is a bunch of thiefs. I cant call them different since ive paid for a new device a lot and i dont have any just like thiefs do they steal your belongings so you dont have it. Great customer service samsung CAT should have learned from you SARCASM... CAT has replaced a phone with broken front glass even though it was broken by a phone user. Now my boss have a good Cat S50 for no more costs than he spent when buying the device. It lasted less than a week 2 way delivery and fixing the phone while the same service ccsonline.pl is keeping my broken note 7 for over a week with no info on when they will send me new device. If id screw that bad i wouldnt work in a company where i do work anymore. Samsung is a joke of a company they promise 19th as a start of replacement exchange but its 21th today and NOBODY got new device in these 2 countries ive mentioned status as of 20th sep 10pm. Today nothing has moved aswell so ill be without my new phone for more time ....

Discuss in comments
2404,2415,I purchased a Galaxy s5 when it first came out loved the phone the big screenand at that time I believe iPhone only had the regular small screen phones. I switched over to the iPhone 6 Plus when I found out about the bigger screen. Ive had it for 2 years now and I cant really complain about the phone. Yeah you cant do much customization with it like you can with android but nowadays I really cant put in the time to customize it the way i want it. When Samsung announced the Note 7 I did my research and was really impressed by it so I decided to switch back over to Android. I preordered the phone and enjoyed the phone. When I heard of the recall though I decided to return the Note 7 and get a refund . I was a little put off by the recall I had concerns about the battery. My phone would heat up after only using it for a few minutes. Now I think I will wait and see what Apple comes out with tomorrow and decide between Samsung or Apple. Im leaning more towards Apple though to be honest,2016-09-06 23:10:27,Do you think the iPhone 7 will get a boost in sales due to the Note 7 recall? Discuss in comments

I actually purchased a S7 Edge which is also eligable for the promo at the very begining of the promotion from Samsung.com. I really wanted to get both at the same time and not wait and samsung would ship both together. Actually best buy offered the promo but wouldnt honor it if you purchased an unlocked device.... Anyways when the phone shipped I was told the Gear Fit 2 was on back order. The thing was when ever I checked the watch was never actually on back order like it was on back order for those of who took part in the promo. Anyways I emailed them several times and didnt get anywhere and after three weeks I decided to post on samsungs facebook page. My watch was sent out with 2 day shipping the next day I wasnt rude or anything just explained my frustration. Err sorry if this is too lengthy... this is my first reddit post.

2459,2470,I think they wold need x86 from Intel and x64 from AMD. AMD and Intel have a mutual agreement currently.,2016-08-14 21:28:59,You think Samsung will Tap Into The PC CPU Market?
2460,2471,Short answer no not anytime soon. Someone will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that intel owns the x86 platform and allows AMD to make chip sets using that architecture they get something out of it cant remember what though. So a few years ago there was rumors that Samsung was going to buy AMD and Intel gently reminded AMD that if they got bought they would no longer be able to use it or something along those lines and the deal fell apart. So Samsung chugs along making their Exynos chip for the mobile market because android plays nicely I guess. I heard that the chromebook they made with the Exynos processor was a pain because the chromium OS is x86 based.,2016-08-14 19:57:15,You think Samsung will Tap Into The PC CPU Market?
2461,2472,Would need the x64 license from amd. Intel doesnt own that patent. However. I agree. I dont see samsung entering the pc market due to the advanced r and d for it as well as heavy market saturation.,2016-08-14 19:33:30,You think Samsung will Tap Into The PC CPU Market?
2462,2473,it wouldnt be for awhile but a lot of things could happen over time to change this. Microsoft is developing Windows as a universal platform which no longer relies on X86 to compete with the ever growing popularity of Android and Ios and none of them need x86. It really just depends what defines a PC for you. Both google and apple are working on multitasking to take their mobile OS to the next level to work as desktops with easy multitasking. As for gaming you wouldnt get the massive backlog of Direct X games until someone figures out how to portemulate but if devs choose to use vulkan games could run on them.,2016-08-15 02:47:42,You think Samsung will Tap Into The PC CPU Market?
2463,2474,Samsung is really focused on the mobile and embedded markets. Thats where ARM architecture shines. The simpler architecture cheaper license and lower powerheat management requirements just cant be beat. They have experimented with Intel in a tablet the Tab 3 10.1 and it was underwhelming. They do make laptops and desktop PCs in some markets but in the US its a very small part of their business. ARM is used in their TVs Phones Watches and a variety of home appliances.,2016-08-15 07:52:47,You think Samsung will Tap Into The PC CPU Market?
2464,2475,Samsung is great my wife tried Apple twice and is officially done with them. Once we get our school checks we are hopping back to Samsung. I will admit Samsung has dropped the ball a bit with doing things. The S7 is a bounce back to the top for them. Note 7 I am iffy with I am part of the phablet community of die hards. Im just iffy with the battery. The size needs to be complimented with the battery because there will be more demand on it. Luckily I am getting it in September so I will have some time to hear from consumers and see how the phone plays out. I am excited for the new features I just wish they added onto the old ones. I dont mind a 12mp camera but please up the processor and RAM because those are advancing big now and they should have jumped on that when phones are going beyond that soon or already. I hope they come out with a versionlike how Apple does the advanced versions of their iPhones and they do that stuff. Phone isnt even out yet so no one really has an accurate idea on how its performing in the market.,2016-08-02 20:27:44,Ditching the Apple Ecosystem..
2465,2476,You dont need to go Samsung ecosystem. Just Android. I owned iPhone since the 3GS this is my first SamsungAndroid phone and I went all in. I have a Nvidia shield Huawei watch and a Samsung tablet. I also have 2 gear s2s. Samsung makes the best Android phone imo and the Galaxy is always going to be comparable to the iPhone. Your really investing in the Android eco system and its great. I still use a Windows computer and laptop though. But it works fine with Android and now windows 10 will allow actionable notifications with Android phones. Samsung does have a first party solution in side sync also which I use currently. I like the gear s2 but my android wear is better imo.,2016-08-02 21:22:29,Ditching the Apple Ecosystem..
2466,2477,I switched from iphone 6 to the s7 edge last week and Im loving it so far. As mentioned already its more of switching to the android ecosystem rather than Samsung. The good thing about android is that its flexible so if you wanted to continue to use icloud you can download a 3rd party app that lets you sync to it. I genuinely dont miss a thing from apple anything and everything I could do on the iPhone I can do with the s7 edge. And touchwiz really isnt a problem anymore.,2016-08-03 03:11:35,Ditching the Apple Ecosystem..
2467,2478,Made my switch in April. I dont have as much as you but I do have a macbook pro. iPad you can still use probably Apple watch see ya Apple Tv not sure and macbook is fine just no iMessage. Right now my only samsung product is the s7 edge soon to be Note 7. I am perfectly ok with that. Maybe for Christmas I will get the Gear VR but other than that dont plan on getting a tablet or watch. I love android since I switched. I almost wish it did it earlier but glad I waited for the great phones. Takes maybe a week or so to get use to it fully but I was surprised how similar android is to iOS. Differences for sure but most things came natural to me pretty fast.,2016-08-02 22:19:08,Ditching the Apple Ecosystem..
2468,2479,I actually just pre ordered the note 7 and am abandoning my iPhone 6 plus. I feel like its worth it and am very excited. Remember that samsung has that easy sync tool that you can use smart switch and I intend to use it thoroughly myself. Good luck.,2016-08-03 10:16:01,Ditching the Apple Ecosystem..

Meanwhile Samsung does care about revenue from selling your viewing patterns to advertisers which they can do whether or not you use the Smart TV. If this is the way it is maybe the Smart TV OSSoftware is just really designed to make it hard for people who are not too concerned or too persistent about their privacy to find the well hidden opt out options.

2557,2568,My thoughts exactly,2016-10-16 14:01:37,[Other] Samsung trying to get my money for fake problems.
2558,2569,Yeah I just dont really understand what they could have broken because I fixed it myself after Im actually typing on it right now. Just threw a case on it to hide the back.,2016-10-16 14:30:29,[Other] Samsung trying to get my money for fake problems.
2559,2570,Not sure about that but I bought a case from Amazon and I asked and they gave me a full refund for the case and did not ask for it to be returned,2016-10-14 15:53:22,Will Samsung compensate for now useless note 7 cases/wallets etc that we've purchased?
2560,2571,Depending on wherewho you purchased your device from you should definitely be reimbursed. Source I work at a verizon retailer and we refund all note 7 accessories bought here,2016-10-14 12:55:19,Will Samsung compensate for now useless note 7 cases/wallets etc that we've purchased?

2562,2573,No but that would be an interesting class action lawsuit.,2016-10-14 04:20:29,Will Samsung compensate for now useless note 7 cases/wallets etc that we've purchased?
2563,2574,Im in the UK and the only communication Ive had from Samsung regarding all of was a txt from carphone warehouse saying that Samsung is recalling the phone.,2016-10-14 13:01:36,Will Samsung compensate for now useless note 7 cases/wallets etc that we've purchased?
2564,2575,Got the email today from samsung stating this Beginning Thursday October 13th Samsung Note7 owners can bring their device to the original Samsung or authorized reseller point of purchase to Exchange towards a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge device. Receive a refund for the Note7 device and Note7 specific accessories So yea they mention Note7 specific accessories I live in canada btw not sure if this applies everywhere else.,2016-10-13 10:06:54,Will Samsung compensate for now useless note 7 cases/wallets etc that we've purchased?
2565,2576,Ive done this as well for all accessories I bought.,2016-10-14 15:11:34,Will Samsung compensate for now useless note 7 cases/wallets etc that we've purchased?
2566,2577,I bought a funbag sleeve for my Note 7 on Amazon and as of now its a waste of 25. Its an import from Germany but the build quality is spectacular. Hopefully my Edge will fight it in well enough for me to not want to send it back.,2016-10-13 21:23:45,Will Samsung compensate for now useless note 7 cases/wallets etc that we've purchased?

2570,2581,hi everybody its interesting to know about Note 7 is this project has closed or Samsung try to reanimate it.,2016-10-13 03:21:24,Note 7 email with new ship date?

2572,2583,I have big hands and i use mine with one hand with no issues D but yeah if you dont have huge hands i guess that would be an issue.,2016-10-12 08:09:55,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2573,2584,Dawg this is why you try a phone before you buy it. I love my edge,2016-10-11 12:33:07,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2574,2585,c,2016-10-11 07:26:01,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2575,2586,Because that isnt what you think it is. The edge panel is simply a quick access menu that you can drag icons to. Disabling it only disables the menu and not the actual touch screen aspect of the edges.,2016-10-11 10:06:28,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2576,2587,The edges feel better when you have a case on the phone.,2016-10-11 11:05:23,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2577,2588,I dont have a problem i got used to it after a week getting bigger hands is your only option. Its fixed on the N7 but its no longer an option.,2016-10-13 02:49:11,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2578,2589,They are fucking awful curved displays are a gimmick.,2016-10-11 07:37:37,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2579,2590,I am actually frustrated by the curved edge too. Glad to know I am not alone.,2016-10-11 09:05:02,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2580,2591,Ive turned the Edge Panels completely off but as far as I know those are just the notification bars and dont actually turn the touch screen aspect off. Do you know of any cases that maybe cover it up a bit.,2016-10-11 04:56:58,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2581,2592,I havent had any issues either but I have large hands. My GF really wants the S7 Edge but Ive been trying to talk her out of it and go for the regular S7. Her hands are smaller so I believe she will have edge touching issues and she drops her phone a lot. I just forsee a cracked screen in her future.,2016-10-11 19:39:18,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2582,2593,My case prevents accidental edge touching. Ive handed it off to friends to look at something without issues. I saw a coworker today with a cracked screen S7 edge with no case on it so I think its fair to assume you probably dont have a case on it for some reason. If you want to use it 1 handed there are some cool cases with silicon ish finger loops that help. My friend does that with his 6s he loves it and says it doesnt really bother him if its in his pocket and the loop helps navigate a giant phone with 1 hand.,2016-10-12 09:53:07,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2583,2594,This is what happens when a company cares more for a gimmick look instead of usability. Yes the Edge looks cool but is not practical at all,2016-10-11 08:22:31,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2584,2595,I know. Its so frustrating. I can either have a hideous case on the phone or not be able to use it one handed. What a shitty design.,2016-10-11 05:10:39,I am embarrassed by my S7 Edge.
2585,2596,Damn... this is a bad bad bad experience. What phone will you be switching to.,2016-10-07 13:34:52,my awful experience with the note 7 exchange program
2586,2597,Get another phone in the meantime and bring it back with you in December. When you get passed security have a ziploc bag already with you and then fill it with water and drop the phone in there for safety. Then return for an exchange at T Mobile store.,2016-10-09 09:44:26,my awful experience with the note 7 exchange program
2587,2598,and the fact that the airline would not allow me to bring it with me back to the US not even in checked luggage according to them. There is no ban on flying with the phone you just cant power it up or charge it while on the plane. There IS a specific ban against putting it in checked luggage though because there is always the worry that the phone will be jostled around and will be powered up unattended and then overheat inside your luggage.,2016-10-07 21:09:47,my awful experience with the note 7 exchange program
2588,2599,P.S that all sounds frustrating as fuck.,2016-10-07 08:49:44,my awful experience with the note 7 exchange program

2591,2602,I agree that having the screen extending to all 4 edges would be cool but you wouldnt have anywhere on the front of the device that you can hold and I bet there would be a hell of a lot of accidental touches. Although this is coming from a guy who bought the edge variant so Id buy it anyway haha.,2016-10-01 03:55:36,[discussion] How would you feel about Samsung removing the clicky homebutton like the HTC 10 and iPhone 7?
2592,2603,Dont forget reachability two light taps for iPhone three clicks for the Note. Lotta functions to ask for from one button. It would be nice to not have to depress the button with the Notes stylus however.,2016-10-02 08:36:50,[discussion] How would you feel about Samsung removing the clicky homebutton like the HTC 10 and iPhone 7?
2593,2604,I dont expect Samsung would have a sufficient tactile response like the iPhone 7 which is debatable if it is sufficient with a button. Just having capacitive buttons I wouldnt mind but at that point Id prefer just having onscreen buttons.,2016-10-01 07:47:52,[discussion] How would you feel about Samsung removing the clicky homebutton like the HTC 10 and iPhone 7?
2594,2605,I was skeptical at first but I bought the iphone 7 and the home button on it was really well done. Kinda left me amazed actually. I ended up returning the phone after 3 days because everything else was just meh and I hated the closed ecosystem but I miss that home button. They managed to really simulate the feel of a click with haptic feedback. So bottom line I would be all for this feature if similarly well executed replacing a physical home button on any and every phone its that well done.,2016-10-01 16:36:39,[discussion] How would you feel about Samsung removing the clicky homebutton like the HTC 10 and iPhone 7?

I just got it replaced 2 days ago on Saturday and spent all Sunday setting it up to be an exact clone as my old one in regards to apps which ones are on power saver settings and the layout. Today was my first work day having the phone. I work from 8 to 6 its in standby most of the day besides my breaks and a few sneak peeks at social media and stuff.

2614,2625,Wish we could trade in our previous smart watches,2016-09-16 01:15:36,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"
2615,2626,I got the s2 classic for 100 bucks a few weeks ago at Verizon.,2016-09-11 01:11:23,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"
2616,2627,MST is hardware so the Gear S2 will never have MST unless they release an updated S2. It does have Samsung pay with NFC though.,2016-09-01 16:22:33,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"
2617,2628,no.,2016-09-01 16:51:48,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"
2618,2629,Price probably wont drop. The s3 is an addition to the gear s line. Its it replacing the gear s2.,2016-09-01 10:36:10,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"
2619,2630,Check on Swappa. Ill probably list my classic up there when I get the new Gear S3.,2016-09-01 11:54:32,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"
2620,2631,I dont think itll drop permanently mostly cuz the Gear S3 i feel are just additional watches available to choose from just like when the Platinum and Rose Gold classics came out. The S3 are bigger watches and so some people might not wanna buy it cuz they have smaller wrists. Most likely itll just go on sale. Source I work at Best Buy,2016-09-01 10:33:19,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"
2621,2632,Since Samsung seems to be looking to sell the original S2 alongside the new range I wouldnt be surprised to see a price drop the same time pricing and availability for the S3 is announced. I wouldnt expect a major RRP drop from Samsung though as they may not want it to seem too much of a bargain against the S3 but retailers may differ in strategy. On a side note I was holding off getting the classic on contract with O2 UK in anticipation of new models and have noticed its no longer an option on their website. Im hoping that means the S3 isnt too far away. Although I would have quite happily gone with the classic knowing the new ones arent that much of a major upgrade. Id hope Samsung would bring the software enhancements to the S2. Eventually.,2016-09-01 10:42:37,"Now that the Gear S3 is announced, when can we expect the Gear S2 price drop?"

2628,2639,The specific rebuttal for Corning all glass falls between a Mohs hardness of 5 6 something which Pasansky told me has been validated several times during the development process here at Corning. So a Mohs pick of 3 cannot scratch glass with a hardness of 5 or 6. So far so busted. Essentially any glass is at 5 6 and the Mohs pick was a 3. Corning is using this as a basis to state that what we see in the video is material transfer of the pick onto the glass. The original video he does attempt to clean it without success. I think that unless someone else does a similar test or JerryRigsEverything follows up with a significant cleaning effort we wont really know. I suspect that the new Gorilla Glass traded scratching for material transfer. If its impossible or nearly impossible to get this transferred material off of the glass ever try to clean sap off a painted car. then it will amount to the same thing in the publics mind. But if someone can show a way to clean these transfers than opinion shifts back in favor of Corning.,2016-08-22 15:58:18,Video claims Note 7 scratches at 3 mohs. Any other confirming tests?

2651,2662,I too have a 6S Plus and Im about to switch back. Im torn on either getting the S7e or the Note 7.. I was going to wait on the Note 7 but the way the specs are laying out I may just go with the 7 edge..,2016-07-25 21:46:02,Thinking About making the Switch.
2652,2663,Good move. You wont regret it. Stop being so limited by apple. ooops.,2016-07-26 01:49:34,Thinking About making the Switch.
2653,2664,Why switch. I switched from the 5s to a lg g3 because the audio book support on the iPhone was fantastically shitty. A few things to consider before switching. iPhones hold there value way longer. Apple seamlessly syncs your stuff. Android does it but its a bit of work to set up. Google play and iTunes for audio are way different and much like the syncing its going to take some work for it work like iTunes. IOS is less laggy all around. G3 to 5s was rough. S7 edge to iPhone 6 not as much difference but noticeable. edit Nothing like giving out advice to get downvoted...,2016-07-26 00:36:42,Thinking About making the Switch.
2654,2665,The Google Play Store will have just about any app youre looking for. Its pretty straightforward apps in categories and there are plenty of options for anything you might be trying to do. As far as rooting goes the Android equivalent to jailbreak it means you and apps you specify have root access meaning if you wanted you could delete your system folder and watch the phone die but its super easy to restoreinstall ROMs on most Samsung phones as easy as flashing a ZIP file from your SD card and if I recall correctly the ATampT and T Mobile versions are rootable thanks to a leaked developer bootloader or something. However its been a few weeks since Ive looked into any of that as all my attention has been on the unannounced Galaxy Note7.,2016-07-25 17:58:35,Thinking About making the Switch.
2655,2666,I made the switch from my iPhone 5s to s7 edge at the beginning of the month. And Im glad I did. The display is so nice. Camera is amazing as well. Its a sleek looking phone too. I havent changed much on the phone I think its good as it is. But there is so much you can do. . I like the info Google provides to you and learning the system was easy. Moving my music over was easy enough too. The only thing I miss is imessage. And its really not a big deal because all my friends use WhatsApp. I think Samsung makes a nice phone and I would do it again.,2016-07-25 20:01:01,Thinking About making the Switch.

2669,2681,I recommend the app Toggles Widget. It allows you to change your phone settings such as WiFi silentvibrate mode NFC Bluetooth etc. Add it to your widget screen and itll allow for easy access to silent your phone quickly before a meeting for example. It costs two bucks but is well worth it in my opinion. It shouldve been a standard feature on the watch. Casia is an elegant watch face that offers a lot of nice features for free. My current watch face which costs a dollar is the Fusion Watch Face which I think is very sleek and nice looking. Try turning on your always on display if youd like. Itll impact your battery slightly but I still end everyday with about 30 to 40 left so its not bad at all.,2016-04-21 16:42:20,"Just got my Gear S2 from the S7 promotion, what's your favorite things to do with it or apps to add?"
2670,2682,Ill definitely get a lot of use out the S Health app. I like the one on the phone good enough but I think itll be more accurate with the watch.

When they get enough inventory again and work through the recalled units Id expect a similar or better promo. After all they cant afford not to sell units theyre already spending 1B on the recall so they might as well put 10 30M into a post recall discount promo campaign so new customers buy a Note 7 or are interested in an S8. Without continued momentum beyond the recall major market share is in jeopardy. Which is why they spent 1B on the recall immediate.

2836,2851,I went into best buy today with the mindset that I would definitely pre order the S7 Edge. After i played around with them both i changed my mind and i pre ordered the regular S7. The big phone with the curved screen felt awkward in my hand and the side swiping didnt work as well as I expected it would and I cant think of when Id ever use it to be honest. Im glad I went in to check them out in person and I recommend anyone considering pre ordering to do the same. Both phones have the same camera and its AMAZING. Puts my LG G4 camera to shame in a side by side test actually or maybe the photos just look a lot better on the improved screen of the Samsung. On a side note the Samsung Gear VR is pretty neat.

But weird thing was there were 2 apps excluded from the PC backup but doesnt show what was excluded. But if its only 2 I guess it doesnt really matter for me.

3176,3194,not to mention that a screen protector completely negates that issue. Those that dont want to use a screen protector shouldnt complain because they arent taking steps to prevent scratching and any phone without one will eventually scratch. Its a minor issue imo.,2016-08-20 09:48:40,Note 7 owners?? How do you like it so far?
3177,3195,I received mine on Thursday a day before launch day. At first I want horribly impressed with it just looked and felt much smaller then my Note 5 only had that for about three weeks had the LG V10 before it. After using it for a day I quickly started changing my mind and felt more and more excited about it. I have realized this isnt the Note 5 this is much better Samsung really improved upon itself and developed something that feels solid and fluid it really seems to work the way a smart phone should. I thought I was going to hate the curved edges on the Note 5 when I would use my right hand svc tried to click on something on the top left side of the screen the inner side of my hand would click on an app on the lower right side of the screen. It hasnt happened with the Note 7 yet I am over 6 feet tall so I have pretty big hands. The way screen folds over on the sides really does make watching videos on it that much better. The side panel shortcuts are really nice the flashlight actually has a brightness level for it instead of just on or off. The S Pen works really well like using a sharp pointy pen. It does feel heavier than the Note 5 so you definitely know youre holding onto to something. It feels like its the size of a galaxy S7 but when compared to the Note 5 the screen viewing seems larger. Even though sized up the screens are exactly the same size. Oh and the camera wow it takes some really great photos I have had a couple of people that own an IPhone 6S to be exact and they could believe how incredibly sharp the pictures looked the camera on the Note 7 is amazing. Your gonna love it. Oh I had one minor problem I put the SD card into the slot of my phone with no issues with my wifes phone it took me a few tries to get it into the tray and slide it into the phone. The SD card kept sliding back in the tray when I slid it into the phone. I had to in the end press on the back of the card as I was sliding it in it was tricky but I was able to get it in there. Thats all hope you get yours soon this is in my book the best smart piggie on the market today.,2016-08-21 00:53:44,Note 7 owners?? How do you like it so far?
3178,3196,I do like my Note 7 so far actually...Its really easy to hold without a case I still put it in a sleek case because it would offer a bit of protection. Another thing that I noticed is that the Spen Handwriting is so much prettier you can get really accurate pen on paper results that I really like. The phone is still fast but touch accuracy seems to be a tiny bit off that issue may resolve itself with a later firmware update. The Edge Screen is pretty useful it has all sorts of shortcuts that can be easily cycled through. Ill have to assign everything I use on a regular basis to a shortcut for easy use. Ive only triggered it a few times on accident before I didnt trigger the Edge Screen on accident.,2016-08-20 08:27:58,Note 7 owners?? How do you like it so far?

3183,3201,Stopped by the Verizon store to pick one up this morning and am blown away by everything. And this is coming from someone who came from a Galaxy S7.

3194,3212,Its one of the biggest selling points but not the biggest. Im glad Samsung finally fixed it so you couldnt slide the S Pen in backwards anymore. I have the Note 4 personal use and the Note 5 for work. I love both of them but I would give the nod to my Note 4 since it has the memory card slot and IR Blaster which I dont use too often. My gf is upgrading her phone this week and shes getting the Note 7. She has the Galaxy S5 so itll be a huge upgrade for her.

Like.... all phones since beginning of year have that CPU and some phones from smaller companies are already announced with Snapdragon 821Higher clockrate and latest version to be released in August.... So except if I got this wrong and that its indeed the snapdragon 821 or that theres a way here in Canada to get the Exynos version I think Imma just wait and grab the next Nexus instead....

3255,3273,Yeah it definitely looks like a prototype build with the dots around the Back and Recent keys and at the top. Before buying check the software version. Sometimes these devices require you to manually install new binaries so you just want to make sure that its been receiving regular updates. The US at the beginning of the code probably indicates that its a US delta so its very close to a production model. The only major difference generally besides the S7 chip is the software.,2016-04-15 21:28:10,Used Note 5 for sale with USCC038 marking on top. What is this?

3261,3279,mind if I ask what AW lacks that the GS2 has. Do you preferuse the GS2 over the moto 360. Because my main uses are going to be reading messagesnotifications at work and being able to send quick replies the GS2 seemed to be able to do what I needed... though it will depend on whether it works seamlessly with whatsapp and messenger etc. I know the Huawei and the moto can also do this but the white screens on all the google notifications bothered me Id have really liked it if there was a dark theme available. I have purchased a GS2 classic from amazon though I very nearly bought the Huawei instead. However the Huawei is heavier and doesnt look like it would fit as nicely on smaller wrists. Also the black version is like 60 more than the GS2. However if the samsung ends up disappointing me then I will return it and maybe go for the silver huawei.,2016-04-14 16:43:45,Considering a Gear S2 - Current state?

3266,3284,Ive had a Gear S2 for a week now not long enough for a detailed review. But I am enjoying using it and am impressed with the automated activity detection and record keeping. Heres my pros and cons list so far Pros No fuss activity detection and record keeping Excellent battery life even with always on watchface 18 hrs a day with 10 15 spare battery left My 3g model can independently take and make phone callstexts without having the phone present Excellent build quality Even though no Android watchfaces are available I think the Tizen stores selection is pretty good and there are amazingly configurable faces available for free or cheaply Charges fairly quickly The rotating bezel is not a gimmick its a genuine bright idea for small on wrist device navigation. I cant believe every smartwatch doesnt offer this. Builtin speaker 3g model is amazingly clear and functional both for calls and surprisingly even music for short periods. Cons Not many useful apps on the Tizen store although I cant really say I am missing anything that would have been important to me given the decent builtin apps No way to enable always on while charging so useless as nightstand clock S Voice is in my opinion very nearly useless. If youre at all fluent with Googles voice assistant you will be nothing but frustrated with it. Ive simply given up on it entirely since I dont want to be frustrated the 80 to 90 percent of the time it doesnt work or does something even worse than failing Wake me in an hour correctly transcribed results in an alarm set for 1 a.m. My S2 Sport requires proprietary watchbands. There are lots of online reports of band and connector failures which makes me nervous. I got my watch free with my S7 phone but would buy an S2 Classic if I was purchasing one since it supports standard watchbands. No 3rd party music streaming apps. Must use Samsung Milk free with ads I rate 610 for function or move music tracks to device to listen to music from builtin speaker. Otherwise device can only control a phone based music app for listening on phone. My take on your likely opinion of the Gear S2 You would like S Health just fine hate and quickly give up on S Voice and find a somewhat clunky workaround for reminders probably involving using your phone and settling for a notification on the watch. Since the reminder thing and voice assistant seem fairly high on your checklist I believe youd probably be happier with Android wear.,2016-04-13 10:38:27,Considering a Gear S2 - Current state?
3267,3285,Definitely battery life. Better build. Wireless charging.,2016-03-30 08:50:10,What to expect upgrading from an S3 to an S7?
3268,3286,Just came from the S3. Battery life on my normal S7 Verizon is the best Ive had since flip phones. My biggest change has been my internet browser since I used the stock AOSP browser on my S3 with the quick control lab settings. Nothing really compares to that convenience but it used an outdated protocol and webpages definitely load faster and more reliably now. Second biggest change is the menu button is now the recent apps button and long pressing the home button pulls up Google Now. Double tapping the home button goes to camera and its so convenient I dont even have the camera app on my homescreen anymore. There are no lockscreen widgets anymore but theres some headway on that with GoodLock through the Galaxy Apps store if its important to you. There are also themes and icon packs if you dont like the look of your system but I havent bothered to change mine yet.,2016-03-30 10:29:30,What to expect upgrading from an S3 to an S7?
3269,3287,I literally did this yesterday except I got the Edge. The phone itself is really nice its fast has a lot more RAM the screen in beautiful but having such a high resolution it can be hard to find wallpapers that arent fuzzy. I use a lot of Youtube and Twitch on my phone so when the content is like 720p or lower it is really noticeable. The thing is though that is in no way the phones fault but I thought I should mention it coming from the S3. The new up to date OS can take some getting used to but everything is pretty well laid out it didnt take long to figure the ins and outs and get it set up how I like it. I dont know if you are planning to get an Edge but if you are interested you should put a lot of thought into it. I still dont know how I feel about it its weird seeing pictures and videos warp into small bends and with it being a much bigger phone you pretty much have to completely change how you hold and use it just to avoid hitting those edges. The main reason I chose the Edge though is just because it is bigger than the regular S7 and I felt I was getting ripped of if I didnt get the bigger size but now I think that if you care about size that much just go for the Note 5. Overall I am happy with it and I am hoping to get a good 3 4 years out of it and I think it is very nice coming from an S3.,2016-03-30 08:33:29,What to expect upgrading from an S3 to an S7?

3308,3326,Seems theyve refined their product line. S6S6 Edge being the smaller phones with only a difference in the edge and S6 EdgeNote 5 being so similar with difference in edge must have been very confusing for the average consumer. Those products had little variation before. Now there is the S7 the bigger S7 Edge to differentiate from that and I assume the next Note will take up the sole Phablet spot. 3 flagship phones in 3 different sizes makes more sense. Most telling in the refinement is that it seems only the 32GB option will be available in most of the bigger countries. Hopefully this means we wont see a repeat of demand outweighing supply as it did when the S6 Edge was first released.

Second image more in line with current design style but a bit boxy trim around camera goes around flash plus a new sensor also looks a bit boxy icons are old style icons. These are two fan generated images that will look nothing like the final product. As for the text The Samsung Galaxy S7 flagship will probably be powered by a system on a chip that benchmarks quicker than the Apple A9 SoC. However the South Korean cellphone maker is working laboriously to make sure over heating is not a problem. Well color me shocked. Theyre trying to make product that is better than current offerings... Odd I thought companies aimed to make products with worse specs every year. We are also informed by rumor mongers that it ll be 10 cheaper than the present S6. That s an aggressive pricing move from the android market leader. Samsung could very well be looking to be more competitive price wise but without a reasonable source or without any supply chain clues hinting at this I doubt it. Within the USA and China the Samsung Galaxy S7 will get the brand new Qualcomm 820 SoC which is instead of the more apparent chip choice Samsung s own Exynos line. And it will be clocked at some kind of ludicrous speed we are informed outfitted with a heat pipe based cooling system. Samsung typically goes with Qualcomm. That was all the big news about the S6 line using their Exynos line something about the 810 overheating so Samsung went with their own chip. If Qualcomm has the heating issue under control or if Samsung has found a way to keep it cool then theyll probably go back to them. Not going to say anything about the rest of the rumor sources. No names and random people. None of this is reliable and nothing is outside of typical speculations. That or this information may surprise a lot of you Samsung plans on making the the S7 better than the S6. They will introduce new features to make your phone experience better and aim to outdo Apple. Then after that theyll try the same thing with the S8...,2015-12-14 11:15:30,[Rumor] Samsung Galaxy S7 leaks - Faster & 10% Cheaper

3363,3381,Definitely check your battery usage. Something similar happened with my S6 and it was really slow would get and stay really hot for long periods of time and its battery would be dead after 4 hours with minimal use. I think it was an app called Ibotta or something but it was using something like 60 of the battery. After looking at what the ap did I think that it was constantly pinging my location and finding local sales in the background. I deleted it and the problem was fixed.

3367,3385,Yeah as a whole this recall initiative is definitely a good move on Samsungs part. But the execution is just plain bad. From all the hours spent talking to the different departments I can tell that there is no communication across the company well in the Canadian division at least. There is no coordination and honestly nobody knows whats going on and how to direct customers to the correct department. Worst of all the reps that I spoke with dont seem to care about this issue or their customers. I mean there is just no sign of any concern or urgency to help out in their voice.,2016-09-21 03:43:14,My Note 7 Replacement Experience (Canada)

3372,3390,For your next device ill recommend you any of CATs phones. S60 is a great device and even S50 is a decent one. Biggest difference between Samsung and CAT is how greedy and nuts samsung is. My boss have broken front glass of his S50 phone it was his fault. Ive ordered a service and a courier collected the broken phone from me delivered it to the service and brought it back to me in less than a full week. Samsung on the other hand is keeping my new device note 7 for over a week now ive send it to them on 12th of sept. and i dont have my new device ive paid for. CAT did repair the S50 for free delivery incuded even though it was a user fault that the front glass has shattered. Samsung is a bad company i dont recommend anyone any contacts with samsungs employes or buying any samsung products. Now only thing ill think of buying from samsung is going to be a fast ssds if there is going to be no real competition in this market from other brands. Samsung phones are only for sadomasochists and only for the hardcore ones. Oh and replacement process was supposed to start from 19th of september in Poland but its 21th of september and nobody has seen anything about the new devices. Lazy samsungs bastards.,2016-09-21 09:21:46,My Note 7 Replacement Experience (Canada)

The funny thing samsung canada keeps sending me emails with return your phone no sht been trying to return it since the 9th.. I feel your pain i am giving them to end of the month with this bs my case has been escalated like 3 times .From what i gather their will be one mass email with a shipping label soon as they fix their sht.God knows if they will screw up the refund next Lol.,2016-09-22 07:46:18,My Note 7 Replacement Experience (Canada)

3410,3428,Coming from The Verge sometimes also referred to as iVerge this is one of the better interviews or insights Ive read about a Samsung phone. Samsung talking about their phone business only is not without faults but I admire them for pushing the boundaries. People said many of their products have failed because it wasnt perfect but newsflash no company has a perfect product. However Android wouldnt be what it is today without Samsung. Its not only that Samsung is the biggest seller and marketer of Android. A lot of the features implemented in Android today came from those bloatware that Samsung implemented in Touchwiz. TW has never been better and like he said someday we might be able to not have duplicate GoogleSamsung apps like e mail or carrier bloatware in the U.S. Ive always loved Samsung for their brilliant hardware and design and now that their software enhances the experience its hard to try and stay with another phone. Not to mention Gear VR Gear 360 Note tablet etc. Theres a certain brand loyalty with Samsung now that I feel. Sort of like the iSheeps with Apple except its because I know Samsung listens to its consumers and they always put the best software and hardware the possibly can to at least justify the high cost of their flagship phones.,2016-08-02 12:31:56,How Samsung plans its phones - The Verge

3464,3483,Hey I had the same problem too with hangouts but after some researching.. I found out that all you have to do is install the Android Wear application on your phone. Yeah I know your watch doesnt use Android wear but for some reason that fixed it. You just have to install it I dont even think you have to open it. You can probably Google for more info on that lol. Hope that helps tho,2016-04-07 11:36:00,What's wrong with your Gear S2?
3465,3484,Its good and very well built but I really feel the limitations of the app eco system. Sure many apps are being built but the majority goes to Android Wear. I wish Samsung would allow Android Wear devices to sync with S Health natively. Currently thats the only thing keeping me on Tizen. I will say the stand alone music is massively better than on Android Wear though. This thing does wonderfully when I want tunes but dont have my my phone on me.,2016-04-07 01:07:34,What's wrong with your Gear S2?
3466,3485,The s2 interface is nicer but s voice is complete garbage and there are nearly no nice watchfaces. The urbane has an oled screen to btw so they book look beautiful. Plus the urbane looks so classy,2016-04-03 05:33:22,smartwatch....Gear S2 or LG Urbane?
3467,3486,That wont happen. Thats the reason it runs Tizen instead of AW because Samsung wants to integrate its own appsservices. Thats a drawback for sure but not a dealbreaker for me. The reason is because for a smartwatch I really notice no difference between Tizen and OS in everyday use. It palys nicer with S Health Phone and Messages Calendar etc. When I had Moto 360 of course Google apps like Keep which I really wish was on S2 integrated really well into AW. But the drawback of that is that it didnt play nice with the stock Samsung apps. Neither platform is perfect so youll just have to find the best deals for both I somehow ended up with new Moto 360 Gear Fit and Gear S2 for around or less than 50 each. Thats the kind of deal I cant pass up lol.,2016-04-04 01:55:28,smartwatch....Gear S2 or LG Urbane?
3468,3487,Thats my reason as well though I wish there were support for more Google apps like Keep. S Voice is a tad slower than Google Voice but its not that much worse.

3471,3490,This. Im not gonna read a news article or do other complicated things on my smartwatch. Its smart because it can do a lot of the things that an older smartphone can do but it also shouldnt complicate it. I think the Gear S2 achieve this balance with great design and simple interface. The rotating bezel might not be revolutionary but its such a great design choice that is simple and pleasant to use.

3489,3508,As others have said its NFC. NFC doesnt draw any power on its own and leaving it on isnt a real concern. If you are in a country that has Samsung Pay its useful for tap and go but Samsung pay also uses MST or magnetic strip transmission which beams the mag stripe to a retailers terminal so as far as he terminal knows it think you swiped your card. NFC on a Samsung phone has been used to share photos musicetc in the past. Put the phones back to back line up at the Samsung logo and the phones take care of themselves.,2016-03-14 02:44:46,Can anyone tell me what this symbol is? Trying to get rid of it. S7

3675,3694,This is why you should always buy the device insurance when you buy a new phone. Its easier to cancel insurance after you know its in proper working order than it is to go threw the hoops of a full warranty replacement. Unfortunately for you it also seems to be a bit to late for insurance but depending on who you got the replacement phone from you might be able to take it back to your carriers outlet location and just exchange it on the claim that its a complete lemon. Regarding the battery stop using it immediately. If thats the only battery you have then you better off not using it at all. you are putting yourselves at risk just plugging it in at night. With the drain symptoms and the fact that it gets hot while charging indicates to me that you have a shorting problem somewhere in the battery. It might not be catastrophic yet but that doesnt mean that it wont explode the next time you put it on charge. Save yourself and your stuff from fire damage by just writing off the battery. Last I checked the S6 batteries retailed from Samsung proper at about 45 50. you could also buy an aftermarket extended battery for 60 80 that would double or even triple the capacity of the factory batteries though they use the same firmware and will still register a drain down to 15 until the battery completely zeros out even though extended batteries would be at 60 or more so theres that ... when I bought my Galaxy S4 I had a similar problem with a cracked screen because I dropped it while changing into uniform at work. On hard tile. It was a hair line crack but something I knew would grow into a spiderweb a crossed the screen. I managed to convince Samsung that I didnt notice the defect until I pulled off the protective film and they let me send it in for a free screen replacement. This was also within 30 days of getting it in the mail. Depending on who you got your replacement from either the manufacturer or your carrier you might be able to pull this off if its still within 30 90 days of getting the phone. Though if you combine it with your battery problems you might run into issues seeing as heat is something that is not covered in the basic warranty. Also the reason why your battery is not covered under the devices warranty is because its technicaly its own device. Its Samsung made and Samsung has a warranty for the battery but its not covered in the general device warranty. If you call up the handset department and complain about this then they will try and pull your device warranty out from under you but if you call the battery department and complain about the battery specifically then you might get somewhere as far as getting it replaced. You have to do your research on this as I have also had to do this with a Toshiba laptop that had a Samsung battery and actually find the proper number or transfer when you are connected with a human being on the support line dont call the warranty claims department because thats like asking for a lawyer to be eavesdropping on the conversation hope that info helps.,2016-05-03 02:07:00,[Help] Battery Defect is not Covered by Insurance
3676,3695,Try to escalate the issue. I dont know what country youre in but in Australia batteries are covered by a 12 month warranty. In fact S6S7 batteries should be covered for 24 months because theyre built into the phone. They wont just provide another warranty replacement at least. The warranty does not cover physical damage software rooted devices or liquid damage but manufacturing defects should absolutely be covered. Hope you get this sorted.,2016-05-03 06:40:03,[Help] Battery Defect is not Covered by Insurance

3736,3755,I had the s6 edge and also thought the S7 edge would be too big. But honestly I cant even tell the difference in size. The performance is incredible though.

3744,3763,Ill put it this way. If there was a version with the same specs and size as the edge but without the edge for less money I would have went with that. The edge is useless even with the features it has but it does look nice. I ultimately wanted the better battery and bigger display but the edge was the least of my concern. It looks cool though,2016-03-15 01:32:50,Should I get the s7 or s7 edge?

3762,3781,This is disgusting. We spent many hundreds of extra dollars on this particular model because of the built in camera specifically for Skype. The TV was sold to us advertised as a Skype compatible Smart TV. We use it very regularly to Skype with my sons great grandparents overseas.

3764,3783,Skype icons are still in the promotional material on the Samsung website which will no doubt enrage people when they get the TV home and find out its not supported.

3765,3784,It looks like Microsoft is dropping support of Smart TVs in favour of focusing on mobile platforms. Samsung seems complacent in not pursuing the issue on behalf of its customers. Samsung still advertises Skype on their TV packaging. Microsoft still controls Skype and its trademark. People are still buying TVs for the Skype service.

3819,3839,Your TV is always displaying a 4k resolution its native resolution. It scales everything from 480i to 1080p to its native 4k resolution. So you are seeing it in 4k all the time. When you press INFO and see the resolution thats is the resolution being sent to the TV by the source in this case a cable box. You can probably change the box to output 1080 and the TV will have to do less scaling and the picture might look a little better but it might not. It still had to be upscaled to 4k. If you hook up a Blu ray you will see 19201080 but still not 4k. Not many things besides PCs will output a 4k resolution right now.

3833,3853,Where is this on sale. This looks like a decent band.,2015-12-23 04:48:15,[Help] Is it worth purchasing the Gear Fit or should I wait for a newer model to be released?
3834,3854,I had the Gear Fit for maybe 6 months and then it just turned itself off and would not turn on again. I really liked it for the time that I had it. It is really light weight and easy to run with and it didnt even feel like I was wearing it. I dont know exactly how accurate it was for distance and steps but when I did run the same loop around my neighborhood it was always the same distance plus or minus maybe a tenth of a mile. That was fine for me Im not going to the Olympics to break any speed or distance running. The problem occurred one day at the gym. I was running on the treadmill but my phone was in my car. I was close enough that it was still connected via bluetooth but I went to check my steps and noticed that on the screen it said downloading do not power off. I thought that was odd since I wasnt connected to wifi but kind of shrugged it off since I wasnt going to turn it off anyway. I finished my run and went to go take a shower. I walked away and it disconnected from my phone. I think this might have messed it up. When I tried to get it to turn on it would not do anything. I would hold the power button and it would do a few quick little vibrations but the screen would not turn on. I went home tried to charge it to see if anything would happen. Didnt do anything for it. Luckily amazon let me return it. I was actually going to buy another one because I liked it so much but amazon did a sale during Black Friday and I was able to get the Gear 2 Neo for 129. I really like the Neo but I also really liked the Fit for the time that I had it. If you have any other questions feel free to ask and I can try and answer them.,2015-12-22 12:05:20,[Help] Is it worth purchasing the Gear Fit or should I wait for a newer model to be released?

3848,3868,For me I started with using a Pebble Steel for the past year when the market was still very much filled with many smartwatches that were too much on the smartphone side. Looking at the Gear S2 Classic I liked what they were doing with it in terms of control. While I can agree the lack of app selection is a little lame if you can figure what youd wantneed right there with you and whats ok getting your phone out for you shouldnt have issues. Only problem I feel with third party watchfaces for the S2 Ive encountered so far is the lack of Stylize options for easy look adjustments and havent seen any with the shortcut features the stock faces have. I personally keep my watch alarms and weather on it and if I need to adjust or know more I just tap them rather than scrolling to the correct application.,2015-12-03 18:47:21,[Discussion] Benefits of a Smartwatch? Samsung Gear S2 Classic.
3849,3869,I got the gear s a few months ago and so far I feel like it was definitely a good investment so far. Im a college student so being able to check my emails and texts in class without taking my phone out is pretty convenient. The gear s does have a full keyboard though tricky if you have big fingers using predictive text helps a bunch with typing. S health is actually great for keeping track of my daily activity I love the nudge it gives me to get up and walk around after sitting too long. I do have 4g capability on it but I rarely find myself using it as a standalone device although calls on it are surprisingly clear. Its a great conversation piece for when people go whoa thats cool is that like an apple watch. and then I explain it isnt. Battery life isnt an issue for me. End the day with 50 usually. Overall I use it as a watch it just tells me the time and knowing whats going on with my phone is nice as well.,2015-12-02 15:50:23,[Discussion] Benefits of a Smartwatch? Samsung Gear S2 Classic.

3851,3871,Is it true you can only use Samsungs hub apps for the watch. Or can you use android wear period. I want to be able to use other watch faces I have seen around the play store but read you cant do that.,2015-12-03 16:24:25,[Discussion] Benefits of a Smartwatch? Samsung Gear S2 Classic.
3852,3872,TLDR If you want a stylish watch and arent too concerned about functionality then you wont be disappointed with the Classic. Ive been using my Gear S2 Classic for about a week now. Here are my 2cents. Aside from the obvious hardware differences between the S2 Regular and Classic eg fact that the Classic doesnt have a 3G4G option the Classic kind of pulled the short stick in the app department. I didnt really care a whole lot about the functionality of the watch as much as I did about the aesthetics so the fact that there isnt a dedicated e mail app isnt a huge deal to me but it is kind of disappointing. There also isnt an icon for the messaging app so if you didnt dig through the settings youd think there was no Message app . By going to SettingsDeviceDouble Press Home and selecting options you can bring up the message app to scroll through received messages and reply to them. Otherwise youd have to create a new message with the Buddy or Phone app because the notifications dont give you an option to reply to the message directly from the devices notification screen which really sucks. And while you reply to an e mail from the notification screen you cant scroll through your e mails because there is no e mail app. Id also really like to see a hangouts app. I havent done much else with the other apps but generally speaking the functionality of this watch is kind of disappointing but Im hoping an update will quell my issues. The battery life isnt great on this device. I dont get a whole lot of messages or calls so the watch will last a day or two before it needs to be recharged. Ive just gotten into the habit of recharging it every night before I got to bed but I could easily see the battery being too low to last through the night after a day of heavy usage. That being said this is the first smart watch that looks really good to me. The fact that you can swap out the wrist band with any other 20mm sized bands is awesome and I love being able to check notifications without having to pull out my phone. I just wish I could do a little more.,2015-12-05 12:22:02,[Discussion] Benefits of a Smartwatch? Samsung Gear S2 Classic.
3853,3873,About a year a go I bought a Gear 2 Neo on a bit of a whim. At he back of my mind I thought Id use it for a bit and then the novelty would wear off but I find it actually pretty useful. I cycle a lot so its good to be able to see texts and email while on the bike and answer calls. I find the timer and alarm function really handy and the fitness tracker aspect is also pretty good. Im currently considering upgrading to a S2 Classic. Ive had a play with one and the bezel navigation is really neat. I also like the fact that it looks like a real watch rather than a sci fi toy. Ive read that you cant answer call on it like on the 2 Neo i.e.speaking into your watch when you get a call this is useful for me when Im cycling. So i n summary I think they are quite useful gadgets so if youve got the spare cash give it a go.,2016-01-16 15:19:17,[Discussion] Benefits of a Smartwatch? Samsung Gear S2 Classic.

3923,3943,well I had only it for like a month babied it as I do all my phones... when I took it off the charger one morning it wouldnt turn on. I just received it back from Samsung today. They repaired about 5 things on it... you know my brand new 700 phone it needed a whole new PBA phone board. They didnt charge me anything for it but i sent it in with its original box and when i got it back it was just in some bubble wrap in an envelope and even though my screen wasnt one of the things replaced my expensive screen cover was no longer there.... I just feel like for a brand new phone and me being so inconvenienced for three weeks without it and considering all the stuff that was wrong with it they could have given me a brand new one... It was obviously a manufacturer problem..their costumer service could have been a bit better Plus i lost my box that had all of the little tools it comes with and replacement pen tips ...

3937,3957,They just seem to make the best well rounded phones feature wise. Ive had a Galaxy S3 S5 and now S7. Their phones are by no means completely perfect but they seem to fit my needs amp wants the best removable storage good camera etc. Every time new flagships come out I always find that each manufacturer has some kind of shortcomings but Samsung seems to have the fewest at least for my criteria for choosing a phone. As far as operating system choice I prefer Android for its flexibility. I feel its sort of like Windows in that you can freely view the files on internal and external storage and customize a lot of things so Im used to being able to do those kinds of things. iOS is simplistic and relatively user friendly but I sort of consider myself a power user so its not really for me.,2016-06-07 02:28:05,[Discussion] what made you guys buy Samsung over other phones?

3943,3963,These deals require that you have an account with that carrier and an active line of service for each phone. The free phone is also free in the form of a rebate so you would have to pay for both up front.

4062,4082,Although their formalization should not be effective before 21 February the new Galaxy Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will obviously continue to occupy the front of the media scene throughout the days that separate us from launch. As proof two new photos exposing the Galaxy S7 front and back just published by the guys at Pisapapeles who got their hands on a copy of this future flagship Korean ... Above all know that the device obtained by my Spanish colleagues has the air of being an exposure model and not a true production model. I obviously wrong but some details make me think otherwise. Anyway just in case some of you still had doubts the stereotypes in question confirms once again that the Galaxy S7 design resulting indeed a mix between the Galaxy S6 front and the Galaxy Note5 back ... The integration of a screen to the top bottom and slightly curved side the reduced thickness of the back camera module and the lack of a USB Type C are also confirmed through this latest indiscretion . For the rest I remind you that the Galaxy S7 which will probably be marketed from next March 13 to around  660 duty free should be equipped with a 5.1 inch screen diagonal with a resolution of 2560  1440 pixels a 12 megapixel camera accompanied by a front camera of 5 or 8 megapixels a 3000mAh battery giving it autonomy than two days of standard use and ship storage capacity can be expanded with the help of a microSD card.,2016-02-10 10:52:32,[Rumor] New Pictures with Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge Dummy Shows Up in Gold this Time.

4072,4092,I plan to never purchase a Samsung product again due to their unacceptable product support. Got a samsung gear s2 classic watch for xmas. In April 4 months later the battery would no longer hold a charge for more than a few hours. Previously it would last from early morning to late at night with over 50 charge to spare. I contacted samsung via their chat for help. After an hour of troubleshooting I was advised to call Samsung. An hour on the phone I was told I would get an email to with information on sending it in for repair. That did not arrive. I called back the next day and this time the repair information was sent. I shipped the watch back to samsung. After a week I got a note back Thank you for giving us the opportunity to ensure you have the best experience with your Samsung product. We have performed a thorough examination of your device and it has been determined that the unity it beyond economical repair. The unrepaired device has been returned to you. Wonderful. When I called them again they said that the device had water damage I regularly showered with watch which is advertised as water resistant to 5 feet of water. What did they suggest. Buy another one. Even though the watch is clearly advertised as water resistant their one year warranty exclusion includes moisture dust water...

4078,4098,Ive contacted them several time and im really please how each call turns out.

Then they give me the address and phone number of the closest repair center. At the repair center things are usually super easy. You come in tell them your issue than come back 2hrs later. They either fix the phone or hands you another one if the issue wasnt fixable. Honnestly for having dealt with a lot of RMA from different companies this is one of the smoothest procedure ive ever had.

4169,4189,I thought about holding out for the S8 or even maybe the Note next year but the damage has been done. The first recall there was a guy rushing product out the door unchecked the second time there was a group of people who didnt care about the safety of their customers and rushed out more defective phones in order to protect their reputation. As it stands they have the wrong team in place and I for one will not support them again until theyve regained some sort of track record.

4177,4197,For performance the models are identical. Same CPU same memory. They both take expandable storage and they are both water resistant. The Galaxy S7 Edge has a 5.5 screen. The Note 7 has a 5.7 screen. While the edge screen is sightly smaller it has the same number of pixels so the screen is actually a little sharper on the edge. The camera is the same on both models. The battery is actually slightly larger on the edge 3600 vs 3500mAh on the Note 7 The Note 7 has the iris scanner for iris unlock and the s pen. These are the two main features that the Galaxy S7 Edge doesnt have. The version of software on the Note 7 was a little newer and a little more polished but that can be fixed with a software update for the Edge. The Edge regularly reviews as the top smartphone of 2016. If you dont mind the edge display some people dont like the curve its a good replacement. You get all the performance of the Note 7 you just miss out on those two Note specific features.,2016-10-11 19:48:55,How big is the difference between the Note 7 and the S7 Edge?

4191,4211,The note 4 is a serious downgrade from an i6. I work in cell phone retail and can say that Ive seen far more replaceable samsung batteries crap out than I can count. Just get a note 7 or if you wanna save a couple bucks and can do without the s pen get an S7 or S7 edge. Plus if you get the S7 or edge look into the memory card promotion.

4196,4216,Id go with the Note 7 or S7. I upgraded to a Note 7 from a S5 that I use to use with a 8500 mah battery with everything turned on. Im somehow getting the same amount of battery life on my Note 7 with the stock battery. Plus it charges incredibly fast. If I can compare it to my 8500 mah battery I think you would be okay without the replaceable battery. It also has the SD card slot. I cant speak for what the battery will behave like a year or 2 down the road though.,2016-10-02 21:45:32,[Discussion] Is the Note4 still worth it?
4197,4217,Just as a counter point to everyone saying no I currently have a note 4 and its pretty fantastic still. It might not be as snappy as day one but Ive got it bogged down pretty hard with tons of apps right now and dont often have issues with speed or anything like that. Battery life has been the biggest gripe but its likely a case of background apps doing things. Replacement batteries are pretty cheap imo and its not often I personally am far from a charger. I think if you have the money go for a new phone because itll likely last longer but if you are trying to save a few bucks I love my note 4 and likely will be keeping it for the foreseeable future.,2016-10-02 23:43:54,[Discussion] Is the Note4 still worth it?
4198,4218,Adding this. I went from the Note 4 to the Note7. Of course everything is an improvement but the things that stand out the most are... The display it is twice as bright and the colors on it are beautiful. The s pen it feels just like a real pen now and is amazing for drawingI use it on groupboard. The camera youll notice a huge difference in the time it takes to focus and is much much better in low light. If you purchase the Note7 right now you should be able to apply for the S7S7 Edge Try on the future promotion for a 256 GB micro SD card or a Gear VR 2. It ends in a few days.,2016-10-04 04:50:51,[Discussion] Is the Note4 still worth it?

4202,4222,Dont feel bad about the downvotes. There is either a bot doing it or someone that downvotes everything negative about Samsung. I get hit with it every post I make pretty much. You are correct about removing support. The newer phones come with USB c and there was no reason to make the deep pocket sockets and extend HDMI for a very niche product. Use chromecast the new one does 4k or DNLAAllshare,2016-09-28 11:25:44,Note 7 to HDMI?
4203,4223,There are other type c docking solutions which arent really docks but more like port replicators but they seem to be for MacBook air. Usb video adapters needed software support to.route the video signal but the processing was done on the host of video card. I dont think android has anything like.that software wise. An MHL compatible phone.had a modified micro USB connector.which I believe meant software as well as hardware connections. Trying to attach an MHL adapter on a non MHL phone doesnt physically fit except in a couple of cases S5 Neo. I am going to guess that since samsung didnt include a dockport replicator as part of the original launch it doesnt exist. No retailers stock them in my area so I cant try it out.,2016-09-28 13:33:51,Note 7 to HDMI?

Ive send my note 7 on 12th of september and i still dont have a new one even though the replacements was supposed to start shipping on 19th of september but even today there is no word of anybody getting a replacement device from poland and germany. So samsung is a piece of crap they lie 19th september .... right ... and they dont give a crap about their customers. From my experience i can suggest you take a look at CATs phones.

4206,4226,Finally I bought the Samsung Gear Fit 2. Yesterday I tried it during a running session and it works very well. GPS is reliable so distances runned are good. There is also vocal notifications for pace by km which is a great point for me. The music player works well also. When I finished my running session I went back to home and I synced the Gear Fit 2 with my Samsung S7 having the S Health application installed. The last problem is that in S Health my running session has been imported correctly but it seems impossible to have the pace by km for each km runned displayed. May be its a limitation on the S Health application.,2016-09-21 04:08:22,Use the Galaxy Gear S3 or Gear S2 to monitor running sessions

Im actually quite fine with the Samsung apps for both of these though I do disable Flipboard. What is the best calendar and weather widget. Again personal taste but Google Calendar and Samsungs widget are nice. Is there a widget like how apple maps is that shows you what the time is to get to your frequently visited places IE when I leave work I read it to see if there is heavy traffic on my way home. Google Now handles this rather spectacularly. I moved all my photos from my iPhone to google photos is that the best photo app for android. Its definitely up there. Samsung also has their own cloud service but its less likely to be integrated elsewhere. Is there anything else I should know before this phone arrives to make my set up very easy.

Much worse than Gorilla Glass 4. Get a screen protector!
4264,4284,well I disagree with Corning. Their scientists engineers appear to have not watched the video closely as they missed a key point. Their counter to the scratch video is The hardness pick that was used in the video was a 3 that s considerably softer than the glass material. Oftentimes when you have a softer material like that and depending on what kind of loads you have used you tend to see material transfer on the test substrate. Material transfer on the test substrate is not necessarily a scratch but it can appear to the untrained eye as a pretty visible scratch. We don t know whether or not that is what is being seen in the video. Certainly in the testing we ve done internally we don t see that issue at all with similar picks on the Mohs hardness scale. In fact we DO know that this is not the case in the video. The maker of the video tries to wipe off the scratches which do not come off hence they are not material left on the screen but actual scratches. I am a bit worried that something of Mohs 3 hardness scratches the glass that is as soft as calcite a very soft mineral and not much harder than your fingernail 2 2.5. To put that in context any sand gravel clay or silt has a hardness 3 on Mohs hence rubbing of nearly any geologic material against this screen in your pocket for example will scratch it if in fact the screen is below a 3 on Mohs.

4286,4306,I use both iPhone and Android daily. In my opinion there will be a lot of rewards and some hardships when switching. I personally hate iMessage as its laggy when texting Android devices but wonderful when communicating with other iPhone users. Ive largely switched to Google Hangouts and other texting apps. However if you use iMessage a lot its going to be a little tough. The app trap is a big one. If you have a lot of money tied up in iOS apps you may have to re buy them on Android. Facetime used to be tons better than Hangouts video too... but these days Hangouts video has improved a lot to where its neck and neck with Facetime.

I literally ended up taking friends and families phones and going through and deleting every group thread with me in their phone. Took a month or so to get completely worked out. Besides that I dont miss anything from iPhoneios,2016-08-03 18:59:47,[Discussion] How hard was the switch from iPhone?

4293,4313,Take this from someone who is about to switch The hardest thing to give up for me is FaceTime. But there are alternatives and I mainly use it with like two people. That is easy enough. Where it gets tough is the fact that I have so many apps music and iBooks and it is going to be a bit of a hassle to transfer them or in the case of apps find replacements or purchase new ones. Just the overwhelming amount of data is going to be a lot. I can tell. BUT once it is all transferred I am looking to having an open customizable experience that I can do a lot more on. And that is huge for me. Not to mention my friends with android are going to stop busting my stones P p.s. I am going over to a Note 7 from a 6 plus.,2016-08-03 22:30:58,[Discussion] How hard was the switch from iPhone?

4304,4324,Thought I would hate the edge screen after my note 4 broke. Ended up loving it. I will say though without a case which is dangerous in itself my big fingers would sometimes hit the side screen. With a case though no problem.

4338,4358,No lag at all on the edge. Came from the iPhone 6s and while its similar Samsung has a bit more going for it. The only major issue I had with it was crappy battery life out of the box. But I did a factory reset and it fixed it. Right now I have 10 hours on battery and am at 79. Havent used it much today though. Usually I am at about 50 at the end of the day.,2016-05-22 18:43:30,Has the S7 shown any signs of major lag yet now that it's been out for a few months?

4340,4360,I was always an HTC fan but was really let down by the m9. My honest opinion is that compared to an HTC phone it lags. One thing you can do is disable the God awful amount of crap that Samsung has without root. They have their own email voice health browser you name it and they have it. You can disable all of them with a specific market app. People say that TouchWiz has been reduced. Ive heard that a bunch of times and yet I have over 100 apps disabled and they are all Samsung apps. Its a massive over lay on top of Android. The battery is a beast on the s7 edge. I know you said you get 3 hours sot. Im at 2 50 sot with 59 percent battery left. Ive gotten 8 hours sot a couple of times.,2016-05-22 19:48:14,Has the S7 shown any signs of major lag yet now that it's been out for a few months?

4343,4363,Dont hurt me dont hurt me no more.,2016-05-22 13:10:23,Has the S7 shown any signs of major lag yet now that it's been out for a few months?
4344,4364,No lag or major issues at all. I got mine mid March and its been smooth sailing ever since. I average about 6 7 hours SOT I have the S7E Snapdragon T Mobile variant. The AMOLED screen is amazing. In fact according to Display Mate its actually the most accurate panel on the market when set to the basic color mode. It had a nearly perfect score. Its definitely one of my favorite features as the colors and blacks are just gorgeous and never get old to look at. I dont have any burn in. TouchWiz has improved a lot and actually has useful features so it shouldnt worry you. If it does know that you have apps such as Package Disabler Pro which can help disable unwanted bloat ware just be sure you know what youre disabling. Ive had Nexus phones before and I have no complaints with TouchWiz. Ive also had a GS4 so I know how TouchWiz was in the past too. Oh and the camera is fantastic. I recently went on a Hawaiian vacation so I was able to test it out on the beautiful beaches and landscapes. My pictures did not disappoint and looked amazing without filtering. The speed is very nice to have to capture moments in time and Ive been complimented before on the quality of this phones camera.,2016-05-22 11:22:58,Has the S7 shown any signs of major lag yet now that it's been out for a few months?

4375,4395,Id much rather water resistance than removeable battery. I get a new flagship phone every year and Ive never needed to replace a battery.,2016-04-15 10:12:42,"Would you rather have water resistance, or removable battery?"
4376,4396,Yes. P Serious answer removable battery. ampnbsp Im less concerned about absolute waterproofing against complete submersion it in a toilet or swimming pool because I see those scenarios as outliers. Yes it would absolutely suck if it happened and Id be regretting this reply. But the probability at least for my use case is sufficiently low that I dont see it as a good tradeoff for other features. Im more concerned about water resistance against far more common scenarios being taken out and used briefly in the rain drink spills being momentarily dropped in shallow puddles or getting your clothes utterly drenched through in an unexpected downpour which happened with my S4 and I was stunned that it survived. ampnbsp The latter scenarios can be offset somewhat with cases protectors and careful use and dont require a sealed unibody to provide decent enough water resistance. Insufficient battery though. Cant do much about that without carrying around and attaching a clunky external battery and cable and youre stuck being tethered to it or a wall until the phone has sufficient charge again. No comparison in convenience to carrying only a tiny slim battery or even the spare battery plus a charger. Plus I always prefer having the ability to physically pull the battery regardless of whatever long keypress combination is meant to simulate a hard power off on devices with non removable batteries.,2016-04-14 19:43:47,"Would you rather have water resistance, or removable battery?"

Ive never tried gaming but I watch moviesvideos and Ive never seen a lag between what I see on my phone screen and what I see on the TV. The direct connection would probably be fasterless laggy than anything that has to relay through a router.

I imagine that they had planned to stop production until the note 7. The only thing Im not sure of is whether theyll ramp up production again to have a note available for the holidays or just silently let it fade out of peoples minds and shopping bags.,2016-11-18 02:37:14,Is the Note 5 Discontinued?
4573,4594,Are you sure you want to buy new. How about a carefully refurbished model with new housing new screen glass a brand new battery and a reasonable warranty. You can save good money and maybe get a bring your own device discount from your carrier. P.S. Be careful. There are some shady refurbishers out there. Dont buy from those ones. Only buy from good refurbishers. Edit I dont refurbish phones. If you want to buy a refurbished Note 5 dont go to me go elsewhere.,2016-11-17 22:04:19,Is the Note 5 Discontinued?

4580,4601,and yet it is,2016-11-17 04:33:11,[Discussion] Which tablets have a stylus?
4581,4602,FTFY,2016-11-16 17:58:40,[Discussion] Which tablets have a stylus?
4582,4603,Yes thank you. Its actually not that intuitive. I really like the various S Pen apps that come along with the Samsungs and would rather have it built in. It used to be just the Note line had them but now there seem to be others just the Tab.. I dont think Id mind getting a slightly older version if it would save some money as long as its more or less up to date with Android.,2016-11-17 04:37:57,[Discussion] Which tablets have a stylus?
