2,"From what Ive seen it can happen at any moment. Its caused by heat, being fed too much power while charging as a result of bad power regulator design.

Basically, the battery Samsung ordered from their supplier shouldn't be exploding under the heat it gets. But the power regulator in the phone is failing causing the excess heat in the first place. So the batteries would be 100% fine if samsung didn't fail on their end.

TL;DR Don't charge it in your car with A/C off in summer. Don't charge it on your bed or any cloth. Don't charge it in a hot kitchen. Don't charge it anywhere that can cause it to retain heat.",2016-09-10 19:05:04,Note 7 Bedside Charging Station

* I think the issue is seen as less serious than it was. It was an issue that only occurred in certain circumstances and you had a lot of people going ""mine's fine can I keep it?"" with a response ""no be safe."" I think people start to wonder if the issue was overblown - Samsung's quick response looked more ""better safe than sorry"" than ""oh shit,"" or at least enough. Also when you hear some phones are ok you start to wonder if the explosions came from unusual circumstance. 

* This was restricted to one device. Had S7s started smoking the company would be fucked. But one device - with a history of solid Galaxy S/Note phones, sitting on the rack next to the S7 which was fine, this looked a contained problem. I don't think anyone expects an exploding Note 8.

* Samsung has a sizable customer base built on phones like Grand Prime, Galaxy On5 and J3. Prepaid phones, bought because ""Samsung"" who makes flagship phones is better than ""Alcatel"" who no one has heard of. These users don't care. Note 7 is some super-expensive slim fancy superphone and has nothing to do with what I bought off the Walmart rack.

358,"Yea essentially;

- Samsung S8 (remove the galaxy naming)
5.1inch screen, no S-pen. Based on the S6 Edge chassis.

- Samsung S8 Pro
5.7inch screen, S-pen. Based on the Note 7 chassis.

I know they insist on 3 flagships this year and 4 last year (S7, S7 Edge &amp; Note 7 for 2016. S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus &amp; Note 5 for 2015.) because they want at least a new flagship phone every 2 financial quarters, but at this point they need to revise their strategy to devote all resources to knock the S8 &amp; S8 Pro out of the park for the entire financial year instead.

To me the S6 Edge Plus &amp; Note 5 are as redundant as the S7 Edge &amp; Note 7. If the iPhone 7 Plus has to be competed against, it would be phones based on the Note 5/7 chassis, not S6 Edge Plus/S7 Edge chassis.

1. Don't be afraid to make it slightly thicker for a larger battery. Seriously, if companies like Xiaomi can have a 4050mAh battery for their own Note phones that cost much less, Samsung should go all out. No one buys phone X because it's 0.7mm thinner than phone Y.

2. More reduction of bloatware. I can't stand redundant apps like Camera &amp; Magnifier. For other apps that hardly people ever use, like S Health or Samsung Gear, DO NOT pre-install them. If they need apps to sync with other devices like the Samsung smartwatch, let them download them upon syncing, rather than pre-installing them.

3. One-up Apple further by setting a default 64GB storage. 

4. The default apps &amp; settings visuals should take more cue from the Black Theme; darker colors so less battery life is being consumed. Sure consumers can manually change to the all black theme; but the average general public are somewhat too dumb for that. (I have a handful of relatives/friends who don't know about this)

5. Yes dual-cameras. 'nuff said.

6. 4GB RAM and disable the loading animations. (You can manually do them in Developer Mode, but again, how much do the general public know?)

&gt; Samsung is preparing to announce a massive and global recall of its brand new Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, according to South Korea&amp;#039;s Yonhap News Agency.

&gt; Yonhap claims that Samsung is currently in discussions with carriers that have already launched the Note 7 - Verizon Wireless is mentioned by name - about how the recall process will be handled.

&gt; This unnamed Samsung official told Yonhap that the battery issue impacts less than 0.1 percent of Note 7 devices sold thus far, but clearly the company is unwilling to take chances.

Dunno about korea but pretty much anywhere else you can sell a year old phone for at least half the value, which is essentially what they're offering as compensation for a major fuck up

Here in Canada the S7E has a trade-in value of $325 currently, with every new flagship release they have a $150-$200 discount if you trade in a phone and that combines with the trade-in value of your phone so that's a $525 discount if the value doesn't drop

Unless I misinterpreted the offer and you don't have to trade in your phone then it's still pretty ass since you'll have to sell it anyway if you're getting a new phone

&gt; Samsung&amp;#039;s recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone will be banned from US airline flights.

&gt; A TSA spokesperson we spoke to said that TSA agents would not be searching for their phones specifically, but if &amp;quot;They encounter one at a checkpoint, they would inform the owner that the phone is not allowed on the aircraft and direct the passenger to leave the checkpoint and come back without the phone.&amp;quot; If a Note 7 phone is discovered in checked baggage, TSA will turn it over to the airline.

&gt; &amp;quot;Samsung, together with carriers, is working to communicate the U.S. Department of Transportation&amp;#039;s new order to ban all Galaxy Note7 devices in carry-on and checked baggage on flights,&amp;quot; said a Samsung representative in an emailed statement to The Verge.

1053,I jiff'd last night. It was amazing.,2016-08-03 12:11:09,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On

1055,Excellent pre review ,2016-08-02 12:07:21,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On
1056,"Yes and now of the much cheaper new phones are coming up with 6 GB ram. But Samsung is starting to pull a Apple to some extent. The Samsung of old refused to be out-speced, The new Samsung (S6 onwards) seems to focus on UX and refining of hardware and software.

Samsung still has very good specs, but they don't seem to throw in stuff just for the specs it seems.

The old Samsung would have produced a Note 7 that had 4000-4500 mah battery, snapdragon 821, 20 mp camera, 6 GB Ram, etc but with horrible UI that lags, ugly looking hardware etc.

1057,"None the less, it may be similar to the S7, Well Most notes have been similar to their counterpart in the S series it seems like. Either way, Wasn't a fan of the S6, Freezes to much, I miss my Note 3 and the stylist, Hope this model is much better, Great for movie watching while in the field. ",2016-08-03 10:51:10,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Hands-On
1058,"I used to treat my Note pen as a stylus. Then when I figured out the other functions and used them better, it's like the song in Aladin ""A Whole New World"" was singing in my head. My Note using lifestyle has never been the same since that moment. Love the Note.",2016-08-01 20:15:55,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1059,Don't discount the iris scanner. Gimmicky for average Joe consumer... But in the enterprise and byod space... Could be game changer. ,2016-07-31 21:59:29,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1060,Still salty?,2016-08-01 19:02:21,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1061,"I plan on using the fingerprint reader 99% of the time, but the iris scanner will come in handy in the winter when you're wearing gloves.  Even if it takes a second or two longer to hold up to your face to unlock, that's still much faster/more convenient than taking your gloves off.

I'm also dying to start using the S-Pen.  I've never had a Note before but the more I read about the S-Pen the more it seems incredibly useful/convenient.

Sure I was hoping for a 4200mah or 4000mah battery as the earlier leaks indicated (or even 3600 for that matter), but 3500mah will still be the biggest battery I've ever had in a phone (coming from an S5), and is still an upgrade from the Note 5, which is really what it should be getting compared to.  2.8% smaller than the S7E doesn't seem like a dealbreaker to me anymore.

And let's all remember, these are all rumors!  We'll know some cold hard facts in the morning.",2016-08-02 00:51:40,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1062,"So I don't want to be complaining about everything that's possible to complain about. The Galaxy Note 7 seems like an amazing phone.... As the Galaxy S7 was
But am I the only one really deceived and unimpressed that they release it with cpu snapdragon 820 at this time for america? Like.... all phones since beginning of year have that CPU, and some phones from smaller companies are already announced with Snapdragon 821(Higher clockrate and latest version) to be released in August....
So except if I got this wrong and that it's indeed the snapdragon 821, or that there's a way here in Canada to get the Exynos version, I think Imma just wait and grab the next Nexus instead....
What are your thoughts on this?
",2016-08-02 12:54:00,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1063,"The s-pen is huge. I was able to use a demo note at verizon for about a half hour the other day and am sold for that reason. Being able to annotate things and all of the functionality it has is very useful, even for the short time I had used it. Sold on the note, I am now an ex-iPhone user!!!",2016-08-01 20:02:51,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1064,Why is that Note specific? ,2016-07-31 22:12:42,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1065,"&gt;This phone will be 5 months older than the S7/S7E, with virtually identical specs

I'm confused why you said this - the Note7 is coming out five months *after* the S7... ? ",2016-08-17 14:57:02,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1066,"I'm in the minority with you.  I hate the stylus entirely. I just don't need or care about it.  It's wasting space inside my phone.   I only get the note for the size.
If they'd make an S8 large, I wouldn't need to buy note anymore.      Considering the Note 7 edge display, I have to pray for S8 large edition I guess.",2016-08-01 23:49:34,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1067,Rumors are rumors. Wait 2 days before judging when we have concrete facts,2016-07-31 21:02:13,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1068,"Then it's not for you.  The spen isn't gimmicky, it's actually really useful. I used the shit out of mine when I had the note 2 and note 3. I jumped from the Note 3 to the S6 Active and miss the crap out of it. Can't say 100% until they officially launch and release specs, but I think I'm sold on it. 

The biggest drawback is no IR blaster.",2016-08-01 08:30:16,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1069,"The Note 4 finger print scanner was a gimmick. They fixed it after that with the S6 and the Note 5, works just as good as the iPhone.",2016-08-02 13:37:23,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1070,Wireless charging though... I literally never plug my s7e in ,2016-07-31 23:48:26,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1071,What do you know about it's specs? can you put the S-pen in backwards? lol,2016-07-31 23:42:50,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1072,I have heard so many rumors. Why do you think those ones are true? ,2016-08-01 04:22:08,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1073,"I'm going to bet that there will be a base and superpowered version. One with 4 and 3500 and s7e stuff and one with 6, 4000 and really powerful specs so like one could be for power users and one could be for productivity because they just want the s pen",2016-07-31 21:46:13,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1074,"I currently have the S7 Edge and that pen on the Note 7 makes me wet, man.",2016-09-21 16:25:23,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1075,I guess I'll skip the note 7.,2016-07-31 23:40:41,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1076,Best Buy has not seen them. I have a sign for pre-orders and nothing more. ,2016-07-31 22:03:13,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1077,Absolutely this.  People that are looking at this as just a phone miss the point of the Note series entirely.  The Note phones have no real competition to users that have adopted the S-Pen.,2016-08-01 18:52:14,"If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?"
1078,"no-one has said how much faster fast charging is. It's that what makes a real difference.

1349,"In the short term, it's a bit of a mixed bag.

On the one hand, you have a reversible connector and you _may_ have the USB 3 speeds.

On the other, you probably have a ton of micro USB cables, and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere.  And none of those will work on the new phone.

However, it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard, and if you've tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new.

Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C, Samsung is the big holdout, and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7/S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C.

Personally, I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that, and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier.",2016-07-18 02:38:14,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to employ a Type-C USB port

&gt; It&amp;#039;s lower resolution than last year&amp;#039;s 16-megapixel shooter, but Samsung says its larger pixels let in 56 percent more light than before for better low light images.

&gt; Samsung is sweetening the deal for early adopters with a free Gear VR offer with purchase of either S7 running February 23rd through March 18th. Samsung says that pricing for the new models should be in line with last year&amp;#039;s phones at launch, so the S7 and S7 Edge won&amp;#039;t be coming cheap.

&gt; Samsung is facing ever stiffer competition, not only from its traditional rivals like Apple and LG, but also from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers that have eaten away at the low-end of Samsung&amp;#039;s business.

If I were you, I would figure out what I want and what the most important things are in a phone you want. Then check off any pros and cons with each version until you settle with what has the better features for you. I feel the Note 7 will offer more, especially with the extra features it has. Plus if you make a habit out of using the pen, you may grow addicted to using it. I forced myself to use it after not using it for a year. That whole year I feel like I missed out on it's full potential and ever since, I have never gone a day without using the pen. Its incredibly useful for what I do, and I don't think I could be any more efficient with an S-series phone than the Notes. Especially with how much they expanded on the pen features, I am excited to get the N7.",2016-08-14 08:30:37,S7 Edge or Note 7?

My S6 straight up burns me and has recently stopped working at a very inconvenient time when I don't really have the money to replace it. I sent them an e-mail detailing my long list of issues with my phone and I got a form response from a dude in India basically telling me ""too bad you bought your phone over a year ago"". 

&gt; I would like to thank you for continuously selecting Samsung branded products for your daily needs. You are truly one of the most loyal cusotmer of our company and it has always been a sheer pleasure to serve you. 

The whole letter read like a parody of customer service. Sheer pleasure of serving me? When my phone burns me and you're telling me I'm SOL? Also, the link to the ""are you satisfied"" survey naturally does not work in the e-mail, and there was no response. 

This whole thing has left me so jaded and depressed. Really, really bad customer service. As another user pointed out, this will probably be the last Samsung product I buy in a while.

The difference is really only about $100, and not $200 like you stated (talking about new). It's really a question of if you use S-Pen or not.

My justification of getting it is that I heavily used the pen. It was great at writing quick notes, easy place to have a quick screen grab, and I just always used it for a multitude of things. I didn't use it a lot early on, but I spent time with it and made it a habit to use, and I realized that the s pen is much more than a regular stylus.

The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion, has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen, has the iris scanner as a security option, and of course the greatly improved S Pen (and the more fine-tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later).

If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it, get the Note. If they're not, and you didn't use the Pen on your Note 3, get the Edge.

1921,"My SO and I are having the same problems with t-mobile. Gotta be sure your dealing with a Corp owned store. My first problem was going into a t-mobile independently owned store. They are the absolute worst in service and complete assholes. 

I've been calling t-mobile over 9 times, my boyfriend has 3 times. We went to one location, the shitty one, then the good store. It took over 3 hours for the two stores and we were almost late for work. We now have loaner phones we had to pay taxes for and yesterday a t-mobile phone support was going to call me back to order our new phones the iPhone 7 plus. Our bill is over $700. We're stuck with ""free tablets"" because the shitty store pressured us to get them. Then after signing the papers, he tells us there's a $75 restocking fee for each tablet. Loyalty dept won't take back the free tablets cause their not technically accessories but they are since you can't get them without ordering a note 7. And our note 7's could have blow out our eyes cause the phone got fucking hot using it with a gear vr. 

I don't know what to do anymore. It's been so stressful with everything. Now I'm afraid these s7 loaners are somehow gonna be our upgrades and we won't get the actual phone we want. 

We've been with t-mobile for 4 yrs. We're thinking of selling everything that has a line (phones, tablets, smart watch, ue boom, and ipad) and buying I phones through apple instead. I'm so tired of t-mobile so called support. They don't do shit but placate you or like in the store you got associate yelling at another coworker on the phone. Its a shot show and it's not totally t-mobile fault but it is. And it's also Samsung fault too. They made a battery that has created over 2 million people that have lost their shit on people just doing their job or in some cases they (employees) ain't doing nothing to help.

1999,"I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7, having to return it under the recall. I really never got used to the edge thing, and battery life was not near even my 2-year-old 6+, but it was OK. 

I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it, with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time. Battery life is also kinda short, depending on what the phone is doing, but it feels like less than the 6+ most of the time. I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to ""basic"" to avoid hyper-saturated colors, it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer-grained than ""None"" to ""150%"" extra saturation. I miss USB-C on the Note 7 also, which is lacking on the S7, which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair.

Honestly I really like Android better than IOS, aside from the up-front grind of getting everything customized and behaving, I just can't take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones. Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor. Nirvana to me would be Android OS on an iPhone.

For now, I'm going back to iPhone, not because I'm in love with the OS or the customer-hostile attitude but just because I feel like I can have the thing for years and know that it won't explode or shatter or mysteriously die without it at least being under a better warranty than ""mail it in and wait 2 weeks while we find a way to blame you.""

Assuming you're not concerned about the build quality, then the S7 is a fine phone. It's bigger than the non-plusses and large enough that I can still fat-finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress, and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it. If you can overlook the neon-glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing I've seen, especially at night when the black screen background is... black. And being able to get content on and off of it without iTunes cancer is miraculous in and of itself. Chrome on Android kills Safari, even on IOS 10, IMO. I don't think you'd be missing anything going to the S7, if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem. As long as it doesn't explode or shatter.

Also... compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster... most of the time there is no waiting for things to load, but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device.",2016-09-16 20:11:24,Should I get an S7 or wait until the S8?

I finally got them to agree to drop my contract and start a new one so I can get the phone. I put in an order for 2 of them, one for me and one for my wife.

2017,"When comparing with the iPhone 5 keyboard and autocorrect, which I owned and used for around a year before I purchased a Samsung S6 Edge (have now had for a year also), I found the autocorrect for the iPhone was far nicer. At first I put it down to just getting used to the new phone's nuances, but since then I've realised I did just find typing a text less cumbersome on the iPhone. I frequently have to delete the autocorrection because the phone didn't recognise the word, refill out the edited part, then hit space only to have it autocorrect again. I don't know exactly why but this I think has been one of the bigger issues I've had with switching that just hasn't settled in; every other difference is now just normal and I struggle to remember how to navigate an iPhone.",2016-09-01 07:00:49,The latest Android update on my Note 4 is censoring me and it's starting to kiss me the duck off.

2021,"I see the whole ""IOS is optimized for the hardware"" argument being thrown around a lot. I left IOS because the updates slowed my iPhone down to the point where it was almost unusable. Gotta love that optimization!

I've been using a Note 5 since the end of last year. The phone has gotten faster with updates - particularly MM. The software experience is actually really good, and it's highly customisable. 

The hardware is the selling point for these phones. You get the best phone screen on the market. Period. Awesome battery life. An amazing camera. Wireless charging. Premium build quality. Expandable storage. Waterproofing. Samsung pay works in more places.

Anything prior to the Note 4 is going to give a less than stellar representation of the Samsung experience, as prior to that, It honestly was a bad experience. Samsung have taken their game to the next level with their recent phones - especially the S7 series.

""If you're experiencing overheating even when not using or charging your phone, it could be down to a particular app. Luckily, the Battery optimiser setting allows you to stop apps from sapping energy when the phone isn't in use. Go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Usage &gt; More &gt; Optimise battery usage, and tap 'All Apps'. Doing this will stop apps from working in the background even when you're not using the phone.

If overheating persists, you can try wiping the cache partition. With your Galaxy S7 turned off, press and hold the Power, Home, and Volume Up buttons together until you see the Samsung logo and then release. This launches the S7’s Android system recovery mode. Tap the Volume Down button to scroll down the list of options and then select ‘Wipe Cache Partition’ by pressing the Power button.

If all else fails, a factory reset might be in order. If that proves unsuccessful, it's time to return the S7 to Samsung for a replacement.""",2016-09-29 17:13:31,"S7 Overheating, is it gonna blow??"

&gt; This characteristic was also bestowed upon the Galaxy S7 Active released by AT&amp;T a couple of months ago in June, but following a water-resistance test conducted by Consumer Reports, it was determined that the Galaxy S7 Active variant was not as efficient in keeping water away from its internals as its standard counterpart.

&gt; Samsung replied by stating that they &amp;quot;Stand behind&amp;quot; the Galaxy S7 Active&amp;#039;s IP68 certificate, but more recently the company backtracked and confirmed that some Samsung Galaxy S7 Active units are faulty and their water resistance is compromised.

&gt; In other words, Samsung won&amp;#039;t offer lifetime warranty for the faulty units, and although new stock seems to have been shipped to AT&amp;T, prospective Samsung Galaxy S7 Active buyers don&amp;#039;t seem to have a way of determining whether the unit they are about to buy is part of the old or the new stock.

It lasted less than a week (2 way delivery and fixing the phone) while the same service (ccsonline.pl) is keeping my broken note 7 for over a week with no info on when they will send me new device. 
If i'd screw that bad i wouldn't work in a company where i do work anymore. Samsung is a joke of a company, they promise 19th as a start of replacement exchange but it's 21th today and NOBODY got new device in these 2 countries i've mentioned (status as of 20th sep 10pm).
Today nothing has moved aswell so i'll be without my new phone for more time .... I bet north korea would replace my phone faster than ""greedy korea"" , the south one.",2016-09-21 09:13:08,Anyone else surprised Samsung isn't doing some sort of promotion to help bring people back to the Note 7 now after this problem?

2415,"I purchased a Galaxy s5 when it first came out, loved the phone, the big screen,and at that time, I believe iPhone only had the regular small screen phones. 
I switched over to the iPhone 6 Plus when I found out about the bigger screen. I've had it for 2 years now and I can't really complain about the phone. Yeah you can't do much customization with it like you can with android but nowadays I really can't put in the time to customize it the way i want it. 
When Samsung announced the Note 7, I did my research and was really impressed by it so I decided to switch back over to Android. I preordered the phone and enjoyed the phone. When I heard of the recall though I decided to return the Note 7 and get a refund . I was a little  put off by the recall, I had concerns about the battery. My phone would heat up after only using it for a few minutes. 
Now I think I will wait and see what Apple comes out with tomorrow and decide between Samsung or Apple. I'm leaning more towards Apple though to be honest ",2016-09-06 23:10:27,Do you think the iPhone 7 will get a boost in sales due to the Note 7 recall? Discuss in comments

So a few years ago there was rumors that Samsung was going to buy AMD and Intel gently reminded AMD that if they got bought they would no longer be able to use it, or something along those lines and the deal fell apart. So Samsung chugs along making their Exynos chip for the mobile market because android plays nicely I guess.

I'm just iffy with the battery. The size needs to be complimented with the battery because there will be more demand on it.

2639,"

The specific rebuttal for Corning:  

&gt; all glass falls between a Mohs hardness of 5-6, something which Pasansky told me “has been validated several times during the development process here at Corning.” So a Mohs pick of 3 cannot scratch glass with a hardness of 5 or 6. So far so busted.

Essentially, any glass is at 5-6, and the Mohs pick was a 3. Corning is using this as a basis to state that what we see in the video is material transfer of the pick onto the glass. The original video, he does attempt to clean it without success. 

I think that unless someone else does a similar test, or JerryRigsEverything follows up with a significant cleaning effort, we won't really know. I suspect that the new Gorilla Glass traded scratching for material transfer. If it's impossible or nearly impossible to get this transferred material off of the glass (ever try to clean sap off a painted car?), then it will amount to the same thing in the public's mind.

But, if someone can show a way to clean these ""transfers"", than opinion shifts back in favor of Corning.",2016-08-22 15:58:18,Video claims Note 7 scratches at 3 mohs. Any other confirming tests?

Apple seamlessly syncs your stuff. Android does it but it's a bit of work to set up.   

Google play and iTunes for audio are way different and much like the syncing it's going to take some work for it work like iTunes.

Both phones have the same camera and it's AMAZING. Puts my LG G4 camera to shame in a side-by-side test actually, or maybe the photos just look a lot better on the improved screen of the Samsung.

3195,"I received mine on Thursday, (a day before launch day)! At first I want horribly impressed with it, just looked and felt much smaller then my Note 5 (only had that for about three weeks, had the LG V10 before it). After using it for a day I quickly started changing my mind and felt more and more excited about it. I have realized this isn't the Note 5, this is much better Samsung really improved upon itself and developed something that feels solid and fluid it really seems to work the way a smart phone should. I thought I was going to hate the curved edges, on the Note 5 when I would use my right hand svc tried to click on something on the top left side of the screen, the inner side of my hand would click on an app on the lower right side of the screen. It hasn't happened with the Note 7 yet (I am over 6 feet tall so I have pretty big hands). The way screen folds over on the sides really does make watching videos on it that much better. The side panel shortcuts are really nice, the flashlight actually has a brightness level for it, instead of just on or off. The S Pen works really well, like using a sharp pointy pen! It does feel heavier than the Note 5, so you definitely know you're holding onto to something. It feels like it's the size of a galaxy S7 , but when compared to the Note 5 the screen viewing seems larger! Even though sized up the screens are exactly the same size! Oh and the camera, wow it takes some really great photos, I have had a couple of people that own an IPhone (6S+ to be exact), and they could believe how incredibly sharp the pictures looked, the camera on the Note 7 is amazing! Your gonna love it! Oh I had one minor problem, I put the SD card into the slot of my phone with no issues, with my wife's phone it took me a few tries to get it into the tray and slide it into the phone. The SD card kept sliding back in the tray when I slid it into the phone. I had to in the end press on the back of the card as I was sliding it in it was tricky but I was able to get it in there.

Another thing that I noticed is that the Spen Handwriting is so much prettier, you can get really accurate pen on paper results that I really like. The phone is still fast, but touch accuracy seems to be a tiny bit off that issue may resolve itself with a later firmware update. The Edge Screen is pretty useful, it has all sorts of shortcuts that can be easily cycled through. I'll have to assign everything I use on a regular basis to a shortcut for easy use.

I have purchased a GS2 classic from amazon, though I very nearly bought the Huawei instead. However the Huawei is heavier and doesn't look like it would fit as nicely on smaller wrists. Also the black version is like £60 more than the GS2.

3284,"I've had a Gear S2 for a week now - not long enough for a detailed review. But I am enjoying using it, and am impressed with the automated activity detection and record keeping. Here's my pros and cons list so far:

Pros:

- No fuss activity detection and record keeping

- Excellent battery life, even with always on watchface  (18 hrs a day with 10-15% spare battery left)

- My 3g model can independently take and make phone calls/texts without having the phone present

- Excellent build quality

- Even though no Android watchfaces are available, I think the Tizen store's selection is pretty good, and there are amazingly configurable faces available for free or cheaply

- Charges fairly quickly

- The rotating bezel is not a gimmick - it's a genuine bright idea for small on-wrist device navigation. I can't  believe every smartwatch doesn't offer this.

- Builtin speaker (3g model) is amazingly clear and functional, both for calls and, surprisingly, even music for short periods.


Cons:

- Not many useful apps on the Tizen store, although I can't really say I am missing anything that would have been important to me, given the decent builtin apps

- No way to enable always on while charging, so , useless as nightstand clock

- S Voice is, in my opinion, very nearly useless. If you're at all fluent with Google's voice assistant,  you will be nothing but frustrated with it. I've simply given up on it entirely, since I don't want to be frustrated the 80 to 90 percent of the time it doesn't work or does something even worse than failing (""Wake me in an hour"", correctly transcribed, results in an alarm set for 1 a.m.)

- My S2 Sport requires proprietary watchbands. There are lots of online reports of band and connector failures, which makes me nervous. I got my watch free with my S7 phone, but would buy an S2 Classic if I was purchasing one, since it supports standard watchbands.

- No 3rd party music streaming apps. Must use Samsung Milk (free with ads, I rate 6/10 for function) or  move music tracks to device to listen to music from builtin speaker. Otherwise device can only control a phone-based music app, for listening on phone.

My take on your likely opinion of the Gear S2: You would like S Health just fine, hate and quickly give up on S Voice, and find a somewhat clunky workaround for reminders (probably involving using your phone and settling for a notification on the watch).

Since the reminder thing and voice assistant seem fairly high on your checklist, I believe you'd probably be happier with Android wear.",2016-04-13 10:38:27,Considering a Gear S2 - Current state?
3285,Definitely battery life. Better build. Wireless charging.  ,2016-03-30 08:50:10,What to expect upgrading from an S3 to an S7?
3286,"Just came from the S3. Battery life on my normal S7 (Verizon) is the best I've had since flip phones. My biggest change has been my internet browser since I used the stock AOSP browser on my S3 with the quick control lab settings. Nothing really compares to that convenience but it used an outdated protocol and webpages definitely load faster and more reliably now. Second biggest change is the menu button is now the recent apps button and long pressing the home button pulls up Google Now. Double tapping the home button goes to camera and it's so convenient I don't even have the camera app on my homescreen anymore. There are no lockscreen widgets anymore, but there's some headway on that with GoodLock through the Galaxy Apps store if it's important to you. There are also themes and icon packs if you don't like the look of your system, but I haven't bothered to change mine yet.",2016-03-30 10:29:30,What to expect upgrading from an S3 to an S7?
3287,"I literally did this yesterday except I got the Edge. The phone itself is really nice, it's fast, has a lot more RAM, the screen in beautiful, but having such a high resolution it can be hard to find wallpapers that aren't fuzzy. I use a lot of Youtube and Twitch on my phone so when the content is like 720p or lower it is really noticeable. The thing is though, that is in no way the phones fault but I thought I should mention it coming from the S3.
 
The new up to date OS can take some getting used to but everything is pretty well laid out, it didn't take long to figure the ins and outs and get it set up how I like it.
 
I don't know if you are planning to get an Edge but if you are interested you should put a lot of thought into it. I still don't know how I feel about it, it's weird seeing pictures and videos warp into small bends and with it being a much bigger phone, you pretty much have to completely change how you hold and use it just to avoid hitting those edges.
 
The main reason I chose the Edge though is just because it is bigger than the regular S7 and I felt I was getting ripped of if I didn't get the bigger size, but now I think that if you care about size that much, just go for the Note 5.
 
Overall I am happy with it and I am hoping to get a good 3-4 years out of it and I think it is very nice coming from an S3.",2016-03-30 08:33:29,What to expect upgrading from an S3 to an S7?

Second image: more in line with current design style, but a bit boxy, trim around camera goes around flash plus a new sensor, also looks a bit boxy, icons are old style icons. 

These are two fan generated images that will look nothing like the final product. As for the text:

&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S7 flagship will probably be powered by a system-on-a-chip that benchmarks quicker than the Apple A9 SoC. However the South Korean cellphone maker is working laboriously to make sure over heating is not a problem.

Well color me shocked. They're trying to make product that is better than current offerings??? Odd, I thought companies aimed to make products with worse specs every year. 

&gt; We are also informed by rumor-mongers that it’ll be 10% cheaper than the present S6. That’s an aggressive pricing move from the android market leader.

Samsung could very well be looking to be more competitive price wise, but without a reasonable source or without any supply chain clues hinting at this, I doubt it. 

&gt; Within the USA and China, the Samsung Galaxy S7 will get the brand new Qualcomm 820 SoC, which is instead of the more apparent chip choice, Samsung’s own Exynos line. And it will be clocked at some kind of ludicrous speed, we are informed, outfitted with a heat-pipe-based cooling system.

Samsung typically goes with Qualcomm. That was all the big news about the S6 line using their Exynos line, something about the 810 overheating so Samsung went with their own chip. If Qualcomm has the heating issue under control, or if Samsung has found a way to keep it cool, then they'll probably go back to them. 

Not going to say anything about the rest of the rumor ""sources."" No names and random people. None of this is reliable and nothing is outside of typical speculations. 

That or this information may surprise a lot of you:

Samsung plans on making the the S7 better than the S6. They will introduce new features to make your phone experience better, and aim to outdo Apple. Then after that, they'll try the same thing with the S8!!!

3428,"Coming from The Verge (sometimes also referred to as iVerge), this is one of the better interviews or insights I've read about a Samsung phone.

Samsung (talking about their phone business only) is not without faults, but I admire them for pushing the boundaries. People said many of their products have ""failed"" because it wasn't perfect, but newsflash, no company has a perfect product. However, Android wouldn't be what it is today without Samsung. It's not only that Samsung is the biggest seller and marketer of Android. A lot of the features implemented in Android today came from those ""bloatware"" that Samsung implemented in Touchwiz.

TW has never been better, and like he said, someday we might be able to not have duplicate Google/Samsung apps (like e-mail) or carrier bloatware in the U.S.

I've always loved Samsung for their brilliant hardware and design, and now that their software enhances the experience, it's hard to try and stay with another phone. Not to mention Gear VR, Gear 360, Note tablet, etc. There's a certain brand loyalty with Samsung now that I feel. Sort of like the iSheeps with Apple, except it's because I know Samsung listens to its consumers and they always put the best software and hardware the possibly can to at least justify the high cost of their flagship phones.",2016-08-02 12:31:56,How Samsung plans its phones - The Verge

My S5 gets worryingly hot if I'm working the processor and especially if it's on the charger at the same time.

3694,"This is why you should always buy the device insurance when you buy a new phone. Its easier to cancel insurance after you know its in proper working order than it is to go threw the hoops of a full warranty replacement. Unfortunately for you it also seems to be a bit to late for insurance but depending on who you got the replacement phone from you might be able to take it back to your carriers outlet location and just exchange it on the claim that its a complete lemon.

Regarding the battery- stop using it immediately. If that's the only battery you have then you better off not using it at all. you are putting yourselves at risk just plugging it in at night. With the drain symptoms and the fact that it gets hot while charging indicates to me that you have a shorting problem somewhere in the battery. It might not be catastrophic, yet, but that doesn't mean that it won't explode the next time you put it on charge. Save yourself and your stuff from fire damage by just writing off the battery.

Last I checked the S6 batteries retailed from Samsung proper at about $45-50. you could also buy an aftermarket extended battery for $60-80 that would double or even triple the capacity of the factory batteries (though they use the same firmware and will still register a drain down to 15% until the battery completely zero's out even though extended batteries would be at 60% or more, so there's that =/...)

when I bought my Galaxy S4 I had a similar problem with a cracked screen because I dropped it while changing into uniform at work. On hard tile. It was a hair line crack but something I knew would grow into a spiderweb a crossed the screen. I managed to convince Samsung that I didn't notice the defect until I pulled off the protective film and they let me send it in for a free screen replacement. This was also within 30 days of getting it in the mail. 

Depending on who you got your replacement from, either the manufacturer or your carrier, you might be able to pull this off if its still within 30-90 days of getting the phone. Though if you combine it with your battery problems you might run into issues seeing as heat is something that is not covered in the basic warranty.

Also, the reason why your battery is not covered under the devices warranty is because its technicaly its own device. Its Samsung made and Samsung has a warranty for the battery but its not covered in the general device warranty. If you call up the handset department and complain about this then they will try and pull your device warranty out from under you but if you call the battery department and complain about the battery specifically then you might get somewhere as far as getting it replaced. You have to do your research on this (as I have also had to do this with a Toshiba laptop that had a Samsung battery) and actually find the proper number or transfer when you are connected with a human being on the support line (don't call the warranty claims department because that's like asking for a lawyer to be eavesdropping on the conversation)

3695,"Try to escalate the issue. I don't know what country you're in, but in Australia, batteries are covered by a 12 month warranty. In fact, S6/S7 batteries should be covered for 24 months because they're built into the phone. They won't just provide another warranty replacement at least?
The warranty does not cover physical damage, software rooted devices or liquid damage, but manufacturing defects should absolutely be covered.

3854,"I had the Gear Fit for maybe 6 months and then it just turned itself off and would not turn on again. I really liked it for the time that I had it. It is really light weight and easy to run with and it didn't even feel like I was wearing it.

I don't know exactly how accurate it was for distance and steps, but when I did run  the same loop around my neighborhood it was always the same distance plus or minus maybe a tenth of a mile? That was fine for me, I'm not going to the Olympics to break any speed or distance running.

The problem occurred one day at the gym. I was running on the treadmill but my phone was in my car. I was close enough that it was still connected via bluetooth, but I went to check my steps and noticed that on the screen it said ""downloading do not power off"". I thought that was odd since I wasn't connected to wifi but kind of shrugged it off since I wasn't going to turn it off anyway. I finished my run and went to go take a shower. I walked away and it disconnected from my phone. I think this might have messed it up. When I tried to get it to turn on it would not do anything. I would hold the power button and it would do a few quick little vibrations, but the screen would not turn on.

I went home tried to charge it to see if anything would happen. Didn't do anything for it. Luckily amazon let me return it. I was actually going to buy another one because I liked it so much, but amazon did a sale during Black Friday and I was able to get the Gear 2 Neo for $129.

3872,"TL;DR: If you want a stylish watch and aren't too concerned about functionality then you won't be disappointed with the Classic.

I've been using my Gear S2 Classic for about a week now. Here are my 2cents. Aside from the obvious hardware differences between the S2 Regular and Classic (eg: fact that the Classic doesn't have a 3G/4G option), the Classic kind of pulled the short-stick in the app department. 

I didn't really care a whole lot about the functionality of the watch as much as I did about the aesthetics so the fact that there isn't a dedicated e-mail app isn't a huge deal to me, but it is kind of disappointing. There also isn't an icon for the messaging app so if you didn't dig through the settings you'd think there was no Message app . By going to Settings&gt;Device&gt;Double Press Home and selecting options you can bring up the message app to scroll through received messages and reply to them. Otherwise you'd have to create a new message with the Buddy or Phone app because the notifications don't give you an option to reply to the message directly from the device's notification screen which really sucks. And while you reply to an e-mail from the notification screen, you can't scroll through your e-mails because there is no e-mail app. I'd also really like to see a hangouts app. I haven't done much else with the other apps, but generally speaking the functionality of this watch is kind of disappointing but I'm hoping an update will quell my issues. 

The battery life isn't great on this device. I don't get a whole lot of messages or calls so the watch will last a day or two before it needs to be recharged. I've just gotten into the habit of recharging it every night before I got to bed, but I could easily see the battery being too low to last through the night after a day of heavy usage. 

That being said this is the first smart watch that looks really good to me. The fact that you can swap out the wrist band with any other 20mm sized bands is awesome and I love being able to check notifications without having to pull out my phone. I just wish I could do a little more.",2015-12-05 12:22:02,[Discussion] Benefits of a Smartwatch? Samsung Gear S2 Classic.
3873,"About a year a go I bought a Gear 2 Neo on a bit of a whim.  At he back of my mind I thought I'd use it for a bit and then the novelty would wear off, but I find it actually pretty useful.  I cycle a lot, so it's good to be able to see texts and email while on the bike and answer calls.  I find the timer and alarm function really handy and the fitness tracker aspect is also pretty good.

I'm currently considering upgrading to a S2 Classic.  I've had a play with one and the bezel navigation is really neat.   I also like the fact that it looks like a real watch rather than a sci fi toy. I've read that you can't answer call on it like on the 2 Neo i.e.speaking into your watch when you get a call - this is useful for me when I'm cycling.

So i n summary I think they are quite useful gadgets so if you've got the spare cash, give it a go.",2016-01-16 15:19:17,[Discussion] Benefits of a Smartwatch? Samsung Gear S2 Classic.

4092,"I plan to never purchase a Samsung product again due to their unacceptable product support.

Got a samsung gear s2 classic watch for xmas. In April (4 months later) the battery would no longer hold a charge for more than a few hours. Previously it would last from early morning to late at night with over 50% charge to spare. I contacted samsung via their chat for help. After an hour of troubleshooting, I was advised to call Samsung. An hour on the phone I was told I would get an email to with information on sending it in for repair. That did not arrive. I called back the next day and this time the repair information was sent. I shipped the watch back to samsung. After a week I got a note back ""Thank you for giving us the opportunity to ensure you have the best experience with your Samsung product. We have performed a thorough examination of your device and it has been determined that the unity it beyond economical repair. The unrepaired device has been returned to you.""
Wonderful. When I called them again they said that the device had water damage (I regularly showered with watch which is advertised as water resistant to 5 feet of water). 
What did they suggest? Buy another one! 
Even though the watch is clearly advertised as water resistant, their one year ""warranty"" exclusion includes moisture, dust, water... So  you cannot actually use the product outdoors as advertised and the company will not support their product.

4098,"I've contacted them several time, and i'm really please how each call turns out. 

Every time, it was for a cellphone (s3, s4 and s5), they first tried to fix it remotely by making me do some manipulation in the phone. Then they give me the address and phone number of the closest repair center. 

At the repair center, things are usually super easy. You come in, tell them your issue, than come back 2hrs later. They either fix the phone, or hands you another one if the issue wasn't fixable.

Honnestly, for having dealt with a lot of RMA from different companies, this is one of the smoothest procedure i've ever had. 

The only tip i can give you, is to be super kind and comprehensive with the person at the phone, and when they told you they can't do nothing, ask for somebody who can make something for you. Usually, you'll talk to his/her boss and they do a lot for not loosing a costumer.

4197,"For performance the models are identical. Same CPU, same memory. They both take expandable storage and they are both water resistant. 

The Galaxy S7 Edge has a 5.5"" screen. The Note 7 has a 5.7"" screen. While the edge screen is sightly smaller it has the same number of pixels, so the screen is actually a little sharper on the edge.

The camera is the same on both models.

The battery is actually slightly larger on the edge (3600 vs 3500mAh on the Note 7)

The Note 7 has the iris scanner for iris unlock and the s-pen. These are the two main features that the Galaxy S7 Edge doesn't have.

The version of software on the Note 7 was a little newer and a little more polished, but that can be fixed with a software update for the Edge.

The Edge regularly reviews as the top smartphone of 2016. If you don't mind the edge display (some people don't like the curve) it's a good replacement. You get all the performance of the Note 7 - you just miss out on those two Note specific features.

*Can I disable any bloatware from verizon, or should I just get a launcher that can hide the apps so I don't have to look at them.*

Can't speak to Verizon in particular, but you can disable most non-essential apps, which hides them from you all together.

*Best Launcher, Texting app, etc*

This is gonna vary based on taste. I'm actually quite fine with the Samsung apps for both of these, though I do disable Flipboard.

*What is the best calendar and weather widget?*

Again personal taste, but Google Calendar and Samsung's widget are nice.

*Is there a widget like how apple maps is that shows you what the time is to get to your frequently visited places IE when I leave work I read it to see if there is heavy traffic on my way home.*

Google Now handles this rather spectacularly.

*I moved all my photos from my iPhone to google photos, is that the best photo app for android?*

It's definitely up there. Samsung also has their own cloud service but it's less likely to be integrated elsewhere.

*Is there anything else I should know before this phone arrives to make my set up very easy? *

Much worse than Gorilla Glass 4. Get a screen protector!
4284,"well, I disagree with Corning.  Their ~~scientists~~ engineers appear to have not watched the video closely as they missed a key point.  Their counter to the scratch video is:

&gt;The hardness pick that was used in the video was a 3, that’s considerably softer than the glass material. Oftentimes when you have a softer material like that, and depending on what kind of loads you have used, you tend to see material transfer on the test substrate.  Material transfer on the test substrate is not necessarily a scratch but it can appear to the untrained eye as a pretty visible scratch. **We don’t know whether or not that is what is being seen in the video**. Certainly in the testing we’ve done internally, we don’t see that issue at all with similar picks on the Mohs hardness scale.


In fact we DO know that this is not the case in the video.  The maker of the video tries to wipe off the scratches, which do not come off, hence they are not material left on the screen but actual scratches. 

I am a bit worried that something of Mohs 3 hardness scratches the glass; that is as soft as calcite (a very soft mineral) and not much harder than your fingernail (2-2.5).  To put that in context, any sand, gravel, clay or silt has a hardness &gt;&gt; 3 on Mohs, hence rubbing of nearly any geologic material against this screen (in your pocket for example) will scratch it, if in fact the screen is below a 3 on Mohs.

The app trap is a big one. If you have a lot of money tied up in iOS apps you may have to re-buy them on Android.

4364,"No lag or major issues at all. I got mine mid-March and it's been smooth sailing ever since. I average about 6-7 hours SOT; I have the S7E Snapdragon T-Mobile variant. 

The AMOLED screen is amazing. In fact, according to Display Mate, it's actually the most accurate panel on the market when set to the basic color mode. It had a nearly perfect score. It's definitely one of my favorite features as the colors and blacks are just gorgeous and never get old to look at. I don't have any burn in. 

TouchWiz has improved a lot and actually has useful features so it shouldn't worry you. If it does, know that you have apps such as Package Disabler Pro which can help disable unwanted bloat ware (just be sure you know what you're disabling). I've had Nexus phones before and I have no complaints with TouchWiz. I've also had a GS4 so I know how TouchWiz was in the past too. 

Oh and the camera is fantastic. I recently went on a Hawaiian vacation so I was able to test it out on the beautiful beaches and landscapes.

Serious answer: removable battery. 

&amp;nbsp;  
I'm less concerned about absolute waterproofing against complete submersion it in a toilet or swimming pool because I see those scenarios as outliers. Yes it would absolutely suck if it happened (and I'd be regretting this reply). But the probability -- at least for my use case -- is sufficiently low that I don't see it as a good tradeoff for other features.

I'm more concerned about water *resistance* against far more common scenarios: being taken out and used briefly in the rain, drink spills, being momentarily dropped in shallow puddles, or getting your clothes utterly drenched through in an unexpected downpour (which happened with my S4 and I was stunned that it survived).

&amp;nbsp;  
The latter scenarios can be offset somewhat with cases, protectors and careful use, and don't require a sealed unibody to provide decent enough water resistance. 

Insufficient battery, though? Can't do much about that without carrying around and attaching a clunky external battery and cable, and you're stuck being tethered to it (or a wall) until the phone has sufficient charge again. No comparison in convenience to carrying only a tiny, slim battery -- or even the spare battery plus a charger.

Plus I always prefer having the ability to physically pull the battery, regardless of whatever long keypress combination is meant to simulate a hard power-off on devices with non-removable batteries.",2016-04-14 19:43:47,"Would you rather have water resistance, or removable battery?"

4400,Waterproofing. With all the different battery cases and stuff out there I think I can get over the removable battery.

It feels like a very quality piece of hardware, everything is solid on it, they didn't cheap out on anything.

I'm a bit sad that some of the apps I use on a regular basis don't yet have apps on the Gear. I can't find any running software that works with the watch yet, Spotify app isn't out yet, it doesn't like Textra very much, etc.

But, I'm sure those will come along, and it's the downside of being an early adopter.

Only downside for me is the Gear app, mostly you have to disconnect from the Frontier then once in the app you have to reconnect to access it on your phone. There are limited options to access the app via the Frontier so all not lost. Overall, very pleased with it, and would recommend it...

4590,"Have had my frontier since the morning of the 18th.  This is my first smartwatch so I assume I am not using it to its potential, or even close, but so far I love mine.  
Battery life is decent.  Right now I am sitting at 2 d 19 h and 44m of usage with an approx 6.39hrs of usage left.
The screen is gorgeous.  
I was concerned about having to have a pin on the watch for Samsung pay-but it is actually very easy to type in and I have fat fingers.  
I dont typically wear a watch so this could be me or it could be the watch itself but I find that the watch continually offsets itself to the left on my wrist.
Sound quality for calls is great, on both sides and I have to admit it was pretty fun taking a call on the watch...makes me a little sad I did not get the LTE watch :)",2016-11-21 12:10:34,Looking for Gear S3 reviews[discussion] [help]
