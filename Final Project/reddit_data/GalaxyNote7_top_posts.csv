3,The sad thing is that some of the fanboys might try to still hang onto their note 7s. ,2016-10-11 20:27:58,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
4,"I had the Note 5 before I got the Note 7, I also had the S7 Edge as a temporary replacement while waiting for the second Note 7 and I never hated a phone so much in my life.   It constantly recognised edge touches I never intended to make and this was a major and consistent issue that is more unforgivable than a potential bomb lol.  So,  I'll likely be going back to the Note 5 as it was a really good phone too.

However, I'm also playing with the idea of switching away from Samsung altogether.  But then I'll have 2 useless Gear VRs and no S-Pen which I constantly missed more than expected while I hated my temporary S7E, but this situation has me hating Samsung so much right now since there really is no replacement for the Note 7 and this second recall should not even be happening.   The first recall I easily forgave and shrugged off,  but this is infuriating now and unforgivable.  They can rebrand the Note line all they want,  and I'm sure the next model will be fantastic again but all I have to say is FUCK YOU SAMSUNG!

Sorry, I got more and more upset as I typed this message out.   On my Note 7.  Oh yeah and the edge is a piece of shit.  If I switch away from Samsung I might end up going with a budget phone instead since I really don't see anything else comparable so I might as well not even try and get a decent tablet instead but that's a different kind of PITA to deal with having 2 devices.  But the Note 5 is the only other Samsung device I would go for due to screen size and type (I'm a heavy user even as home liked right now), as well as a good camera and of course the S-Pen.",2016-10-11 21:32:39,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."

8,"Goodnight sweet prince. You flew too close to the Sun...or something, nobody really knows why you're catching on fire.

I guess it's back to my trusty old S5 I reactivated it a few minutes ago, There is nothing on the market I'm willing to plop down $800+ dollars for. The Note 7 ticked all the boxes for me, except, tragically the one that ended up mattering the most (removable battery).

13,"Wow, that's sort of my experience. Never wanted to touch Samsung with a 10 foot pole. Got my wife a GalaxyTab a few years ago. Think it ran Honeycomb. They were like 18 months late on the ICS upgrade, and it came out after Jellybean was available. The performance took a nose dive, and they then immediately ended support for the thing. So, I decided I was done with Samsung.

Then they released the Note 7, and after reading, watching video reviews, and playing with them in the store, I decided to take a chance on it. Absolutely loved it. TouchWiz wasn't as bad as it was back in the day and it had the design, features, quality, everything... I actually liked it and did not regret returning to Samsung. But, after 2 rounds of recalls and now the end of the Note 7, I think I'm just going to return it and go back to my ""never again"" ways when it comes to Samsung.",2016-10-11 13:47:50,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
14,Well... I returned my replacement Note 7 today. I am constantly indoors surrounded by others because of school and I don't want my professors to see me as a walking fire hazard. Placed an order for an iPhone 7+ and I'll have to wait till November or something ridiculous like that to get it in the mail. Good thing I have an old HTC Desire to tide me over until then.,2016-10-11 14:54:16,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
15,:( RIP. ,2016-10-11 12:03:24,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
16,"No, full recall means no support, no security updates, and possible carrier block on the phones. I agree that the Pixel is a massive fail, and the iPhone seems like a non-starter (I left iOS almost three years ago because it was too limiting). Actually, I might try iOS again, but I gave up dongles for A/V connection with the HTC Wizard. 

S7E does feel like huge step backwards. It would also mean that I'm ""wasting"" my carrier subsidy on a last-year's model phone (the Note 7 and the S7E are both $299 from my carrier) and that I wouldn't be eligible for a subsidy next summer if a Note 8 (or whatever they will re-brand it as) comes out.  ",2016-10-11 19:51:29,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
17,I've never felt like such a stalker before. Intently watching my phone whenever I charged it really made me think about my life choices.,2016-10-11 11:12:53,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
18,"Have you confirmed that? I'm with at&amp;t and plan to raise hell. I extended my contract based on being able to lease the Note 7. When it was recalled, patched to have annoying messages, and you know, started catching people's houses and cars on fire, that contract was materially and substantially changed. ",2016-10-11 12:54:17,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
19,"I ordered my Note 7 the same day the [Southwest pocket smoke story](http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/uh-oh-are-replacement-galaxy-note-7s-still-exploding--1330000) broke. Literally, I went to verizon, set up my upgrade, went back to work, and the lead story on CNN was that guy. 

I was PISSED. thinking that I should've gone with the S7; that them not having it in the store was an omen. But then, I realized how small the actual incident rate is. ~55 cases out of **hundreds of thousands** of units, plus the supposed cases with the replacements rarely, if ever, had an evidence.

I'm honestly glad I didn't get cold feet. I absolutely love this phone, and I've only had it for 6 days. I will be sorely disappointed if they brick the phone. despite the hysteria, it truly is a wonderful device.",2016-10-11 14:47:53,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."

21,Tell me about it. Been trying to get a Note since the Note 4 but it's release didn't line up witn my upgrade so ended up locked in with an S5 for 2 years. Imagine my joy when the Note 7 lined up perfectly with my next upgrade? Then it got recalled. The day before I was going to go pick it up. One day. Then I waited and pulled so many strings to get a T-Mobile manager to sell me a replacement model as new so I could get it early. Now this. It just wasn't meant to be.,2016-10-11 11:56:52,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
22,"I have an appointment on Saturday to exchange my Note for an Edge. I'm super sad, I love this phone so much but I just don't want to have to worry about something happening. I really hope they don't end the Note line because it is awesome. Hopefully Samsung learns from this mistake and actually takes the time to make sure their phones won't fucking catch on fire.

23,"Same here, dusting off the iPhone 6. Don't really want anything else right now. ",2016-10-11 14:14:50,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."
24,"I feel so defeated. There is no other phone that matches the comprehensive assortment of hardware and software features. Sure it stutters not and then, but it feels like the complete package. No other phone matches the amount of features this phone has, and every phone I look into as a replacement is always missing something that the Note 7 had. I was willing to pay a premium because of this.

The Pixel XL is looking to be the next choice, but no SD card and the 128 GB is actually slightly more expensive. With less features.

The S7 Edge's size is slightly smaller, and the edges blow in comparison to the Note 7.

LG V20 is a gamble, and the screen is not as good.

The Note 7 had it all (except sound). Amazing screen, fantastic camera, VR, 256GB sd card, 64 GB onboard, S-Pen, fingerprint sensor, solid build, great aesthetics, and even lesser-used features like water resistance and an eye-scanner.

Everything else is a compromise. I'm so sad. =(",2016-10-11 18:50:42,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an honor."

51,"For those that want to hang on to their Note 7's a bit longer but want to feel safer while charging it, Hobby stores sell these pouches called a ""LiPo Safe Bag"". They are designed for charging large Lithium Polymer batteries for RC Heli's &amp; Planes safely / safer in the house. Perhaps those may become handy to protect your home, car, etc from a battery failure. You can get the lipo bags on Amazon for $10 - 20 dollars now. 

Another thing I wanted to mention: I'm unsure if this happened to OP or anyone else with a Note 7 that had a battery fail while charging, but a guy I used to fly RC Heli's with had a large LiPo fail &amp; start on fire or vent smoke in his house while sitting on ceramic tile (he was outside cutting the grass &amp; didn't know until he stopped the lawnmower &amp; heard smoke detectors going off in his house. His was not in a LiPo Safe Bag either). While it didn't burn anything in his home, he told me that the smoke smelled horrific, damaged the paint on the walls in that room from the soot &amp; got into the HVAC system so the whole house smelled terrible. He also had to get his HVAC cleaned out if I remember correctly. Keep in mind this was a large LiPo 6 cell though &amp; the smoke may not be so bad from the batteries in a Note 7.

I'd be curious to know how bad the smoke / smell was though. I was going to get a Note 7 myself in a couple weeks, just bought a GS7 edge a few months ago but still wanted to upgrade for the S pen (I had a Note 3 years ago &amp; loved it). Best of luck to everyone.

Google's Pixel is not on T-Mobile and I've had bad experiences with LG so the V20 is a no-go, so I really have no choice to go back to a S7 Edge because everything else on T-Mobile's stock is way too much of a downgrade.

844-365-6197 is the note 7 hotline, they answered and then transferred me to exchange rep. 20 min wait on the phone told me they are issuing full $864 or whatever it was refund to all customers even monthly installment customers, she took my address and sent me a prepaid box to send the phone back. After it is received there will be a 14 day processing period and then we get refunded...... As for a loaner or any other compensation we are shit out of luck. She actually told me to go buy a prepaid phone for a few weeks.....

She said there will be an official update at some point, but considering I called earlier and they could do nothing this seems like the recall has started.

She said no time table to return the note 7.

It seems as though most folks rarely ever buy the latest and greatest household appliances, and just about everyone has some appliance that's been out for awhile. I think as phones become more and more expensive, you might see this transition. Its interesting how carriers try so hard to set everyone up to upgrade after only 1 year. So what about this phone recycling ordeal? Just as a example, Isn't there a conflict of interest between Silicon Valley tech companies like Apple and environmental folks when it comes to the mass production of expensive technology, all while extracting rare earth elements using ""slave"" labor?  Then they through a giant party every year to get people in line to buy a new iPhone every year?

1376,"Please, please, PLEASE let this be true. I have made my peace (sort of) that the phone needs to go back. I don't *want* the S7E (much less to be locked into an agreement with Verizon for it for the next two years), but would be more than happy to take it in the interim with the guarantee I could trade it in for whatever ends up being the Note 7's successor, whether it be named a Note or a Samsung Galaxy Pro or the goddamn Samsung Supernova if they've got jokes. Let us take an S7/S7E and be able to trade it in for a free/extremely discounted Note 8 or whatever the hell you call it when it launches. THEN I will feel like Samsung is actually trying to make up for this clusterfuck.

Edit: I'd like to clarify that I tried to exchange for an S7E yesterday and was unable to as all Best Buys in my area are out of stock of them, and they ""could not order them"" for me.

Also bought a Samsung smart TV which turned out to not be so smart. Plus this whole recall has left me in a lurch. I sent my old phone which only had 3 months of payments on it back to AT&amp;T since I saw no reason why I should pay 100 dollars to keep it. They said they can't give it back but I can buy another phone from them. Meaning I'm now stuck paying 600-800 dollars for a phone I do not even want.  
  
And I personally don't like how communicative Samsung has been, especially during round 2 of this recall. The only email I have gotten was from Oculus of all people. Nothing from Samsung or AT&amp;T. If I didn't watch the news and this subreddit, I'd be oblivious to the replacement issue.  
  
I know a lot of that may be a little persnickety, but I'm done with Samsung for now. I'm probably going to go with Nexus 6P or Pixel XL if they start selling them again soon.

Honestly, just to be on the safer side of things, I would just bite the bullet and send it in whenever we can and just get it over with.

&gt; Southwest Airlines flight 944 from Louisville to Baltimore was evacuated this morning while still at the gate because of a smoking Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.

&gt; More worryingly, the phone in question was a replacement Galaxy Note 7, one that was deemed to be safe by Samsung.

&gt; The Verge spoke to Brian Green, owner of the Note 7, on the phone earlier today and he confirmed that he had picked up the new phone at an AT&amp;T store on September 21st. A photograph of the box shows the black square symbol that indicates a replacement Note 7 and Green said it had a green battery icon.

That's enough. Samsung had one chance to fix the issue.

They've fucked it up big time.

All Note 7 sales need to stop immediately.

The best way to save the Note series and possibly even the entire Samsung brand is to bring back removable batteries. If there are any battery defects, recalls would be far less painful and 3rd party batteries would be an option. Consumers can also regularly check removable batteries themselves via spin test.

The galaxy s5 is proof positive that phones can have removable batteries, thin bodies, and decent water resistance. They can also change the rear cover material to something a little more premium and improve the fastening design to prevent the device from disassembling itself when dropped if anyone still cares about that.

Given the current state of battery tech, 0% failure rates are unrealistic and battery defects will happen. Lithium batteries should not be embedded.",2016-10-09 11:38:50,[DISCUSSION] One of the replacement 'exploding Note 7' stories was FALSE.. the user had lied!

I wish Samsung would sell the phone with such good battery life out of the box. For this I had to disable the big 3:

* **Facebook + Messenger** (I use swipe)
* **Google Photos** (I have 250,000 photos in the cloud and they haven't optimized for that) - *scheduled enable at night when on charger for backups*

2091,"Amen to that, my friend. I miss this phone already and am really sad to let it go... Now for a totally optional story... 

I fell in love with the Note line when I won a Galaxy Note 2 in 2012. It was totally unexpected and I entered the drawing on a whim. The phone was amazing and the S Pen was something that set it apart from every other phone out there...

My time with it was short lived, unfortunately, since my family switched to T-mobile from Sprint, and the Sprint Note 2 did not have a SIM card slot. I went back to the iPhone 4s and stuck to it for the better part of four years. All the while, I was wanting another Note device. I still used my Note 2 as a tablet of sorts, and loved it!

The Note 4 was out of my budget, and the Note 5 was lacking the SD card slot that it needed to appeal to me. I waited (im)patiently, and as the S7 was unveiled, and expandable storage was revealed, I was hopeful that the next Note would be the one to get. 

Enter the Note 7, it was amazing. I finally was able to purchase it and it was all that I wanted and more. I finally had income to afford it, and the timing was just perfect. I got it day 1, and loved it. But then the recall happened... I had just gotten comfortable with the phone, but decided to trade it in. 

I got the S7 Edge in the meantime and it just wasn't as good. The updates to the edges and TouchWiz in the Note 7 were just too good, and I missed that. Now that I'm back with my Note 7 and finally readjusted, it's going to be hard to let go of it once again. It feels like no other phone even comes close. 

Goodbye, my Note 7, it was fun while it lasted, but you were ahead of your time. I can only hope that your successor can match (and hopefully surpass) you. ",2016-10-11 09:27:04,[Discussion] Let's all take a moment to mourn

I still have my Note 5 that I'm using as my work phone.

A small accident and a stray static spark - even the RF transmission that occurs just from my phone ringing, can set it off and destroy the place where I live, all of my child's memories, my wife's family home, and a solid 1/4-1/3 of my entire net worth - and possibly kill my whole family in a horrble, painful death. Yes, I live with the fear and danger of parking two cars *and* some spare gasoline cans in my garage. Not only that, but - combined, there is a 0.0016% chance that one of the three of us will killed by lightning during our lives and - this is the insane part - we still go outside. I know, it's like we're adrenaline junkies or something.

On the serious side: has there been a single explosion of a Note 7 device? The only photos I've seen are of discolored (phone) bodies and screens - all intact. Not a single *explosive* event.

&gt; Samsung&amp;#039;s recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone will be banned from US airline flights.

&gt; A TSA spokesperson we spoke to said that TSA agents would not be searching for their phones specifically, but if &amp;quot;They encounter one at a checkpoint, they would inform the owner that the phone is not allowed on the aircraft and direct the passenger to leave the checkpoint and come back without the phone.&amp;quot; If a Note 7 phone is discovered in checked baggage, TSA will turn it over to the airline.

&gt; &amp;quot;Samsung, together with carriers, is working to communicate the U.S. Department of Transportation&amp;#039;s new order to ban all Galaxy Note7 devices in carry-on and checked baggage on flights,&amp;quot; said a Samsung representative in an emailed statement to The Verge.

Samsung is encouraging for customers to return their Samsung Note 7 phones.   For your convenience, you may return your Samsung Note 7 phone you purchased online.

So I responded with:

Question, how am I supposed to return the phone before I receive the new one?  This is my primary phone and do not have a backup.  

Why is this recall process different than the one in the UK?  

That one seems more customer oriented.  SamsungUSA's process is more of a return.  Why is SamsungUSA encouraging returns rather than exchanges? 

Thank you, 

Hope I get a reply soon.

2205,"So i Preordered my Note 7 T-mobile variant through Samsung's website on the 23rd and have never received any phone at all that i can exchange so i think i should be confident that the phone i get is most likely gonna be without the battery issues. But i was curious to know an estimate of when i will get my phone and i wrote an email through samsung's website.( not my carrier)  One of the Samsung's online reps emailed this back to me:

'"" Hello,
I understand you want to know your order status. I have reviewed your order and see the products are on backorder.  We have been provided with an ETA restock of 9/06/16 for both products from our fulfillment center. We are only provided ETA restock dates and this is what we give our customers. Please know the ETA restock date can change if the fulfillment center is not provided with enough units to fulfill the orders. We try our best to ship orders as quickly as possible. We apologize for any inconveniences that may have impacted your experience with Samsung. We at Samsung appreciate your business, and we sincerely hope that this situation doesn’t deter you from continuing to purchase products of the Samsung brand. If you have any other questions or concerns please email me back. Have a great day!""

I don't know if this is accurate information about the restock being today or not but it was news to me. again, This isn't Carrier representative telling me about the restock but a samsung rep, As far as i know carriers wouldn't get stocked with new phones for a week at least. I was just curious and wanted to share this.  Let me know if anyone is in the same situation as me. 

But Anyways, I am not cancelling my order butI will be patiently waiting for my Note 7 till samsung figures it out. I have a 6plus and a S7 for the time being

2208,"I've had a couple situations like this too. First spoke to best buy the Friday the recall was announced and they didn't have any information regarding the recall yet. 

Called sprint after and they said I didn't need to replace it if I wasn't having any problems, but they would switch it out when they're available if I really wanted. 

Spoke to best buy today again and they finally knew what was going on and said they would switch it out for an S7 or S7 Edge, OR I could wait until the new Notes came in, but again emphasized that it wasn't a big deal with only 30-some cases out of the millions sold. 

Seems like they are trying to downplay it a lot, even after I told them you can never tell anything is wrong until it happens and that it's all the same battery outside of China. Oh well. I'll keep checking with best buy so I can replace it. ",2016-09-06 21:37:04,Can we get a sticky post with recall information?
2209,"This kinda happened to me. I went to my local corporate VZW store and talked with my usual rep. I basically told him I wanted an interim device until the Note 7 without the battery explosion feature came into the store. He gladly gave me a Champagne S7E and told me to check in next week with him and they'll swap it out again. No problems, no restocking fees, and an S7E to hold me over. I was satisfied.

2212,"I know people have been getting different information from different reps so take this however you want because for all I know the guy may not have known what he was talking about. I just called 611 to talk with a T-Mobile rep. I asked (just out of curiosity) ""what if someone brings their Note 7 in to get a new one and it's cracked/shattered?"" 

He told me that they will not replace it because the battery is the issue. He said if you have insurance on the phone, you can get a new Note 7 but you have to pay the deductible. If you don't have insurance than from what he's saying, they will not replace it. He basically said the same thing about water damage too.

Like I said this could be false or he could've been told the wrong thing. I'm not sure if this is their policy but I wanted to post it here in case it turns out to be true.

I think they should replace every Note 7 regardless because if it blows up/melts after they turned you down I feel like it could be on them. But idk, maybe they could say ""you were told to get/buy a new one and you didn't"". Who knows.",2016-09-06 17:10:27,Can we get a sticky post with recall information?

They are primarily a marketing company. Bad press equals bad profits. They try very hard to quietly fix issues, even when the issues could pose a physical and/or software dangers to the end user. There is years of proof with that. Samsung on the other hand while not perfect, decided they are going to take the PR hit on it and make it extremely public in the best interest of their customers. Samsung/Google also has a history of doing that as well. (You could throw Microsoft in there to). You will NEVER see Apple do a voluntary recall of anything. The governments would have to force it.

Originally, I thought that GG5 was stronger against cracks and weaker against scratches compared to the GG4... and vice versa.

Three weeks later there are battery fires - but with ""good"" batteries. How can this be? We all saw the results with our own eyes. The testing tools were professionally maintained and kept in good shape with the manufacturer supplied maintenance.   
Maybe - just maybe - there was a problem with the testing. Maybe there was a problem with the batteries (they could have been borderline).   
Or maybe it was something else, but the demand for repair and replacement was so great that delving into the problem deeper *after you already found the culprit* didn't make sense.

AT&amp;T charges a premium on the note 7 ($849 everywhere else whereas its $879 at ATT) and their service is more expensive too. 

They are slow to roll out OS updates and they certainly aren't the quickest to get these in our hands. Verizon is a faster and more reliable network in my experience (YMMV).

Look at my bank account and the double charge is gone and that I wasn't even charged at all. Called support again, they say its still processing, online team says it's cancelled... Such a PITA.

2890,"&gt;covering your own ass down the line

This is very true. The nature of the defect in the battery seems to be related to failure of internal structure of the battery which seems to be triggered by the charging current, heat or both. The phones in which the issue has already manifested itself had the batteries so defective that this failure happened early on. If the quality is bad that may mean that others may need more time for the issue to manifest itself. Which means that if the battery hasn't exploded yet it may still explode in the future, and the more time passes by, the more the probability of the failure. 

TLDR: depending on what the issue is exactly, chances of explosion may increase with time.",2016-09-04 00:13:53,Why would anybody NOT utilise this recall?

3031,"Yeah, it would help if people stopped talking about them ""exploding"". There are no houses going up in mushroom clouds and the ""explosion"" really is nothing to do with the danger. The danger is that it is a small fire, and one that is not totally straight forward to put out. To be truthful, the actual ""danger"" is quite low even if it does ""explode"". Since it happens in the vast majority of cases while charging people are rarely in contact with the phone, and out of every instance so far nobody has suffered more than very minor burns.

3053,"It would be stupid of Samsung to take that aggressive of a stance. I have a strong suspicion that Samsung is going to offer HUGE trade in deals of other brands, if not outright paying off whatever you owe on it and still giving you either cash or good incentives when the 8 comes out to bring back those iPhone/Pixel/V20 refugees. This is on them, and waiting 2 weeks after a recall to give incentives for sticking with them was a horrible mistake as well. When the second recall was announced it should have come with a plan like this announced in the press release. They should have worked from day 1 to keep loyal customers, no matter the potential hit to their earnings. What better word of mouth from someone than a former Note 7 owner praising the Note 8 and Samsung again? Instead the just said, ""Power it off now, turn it in."" And everyone that upgraded their phone and didn't have an old one paid off lying around were forced into new phones. And not a whole hell of a lot of them decided, ""Well, let me go with the same brand and the almost identical phone to the one that is in the news now.""

Samsung is well aware of this, I'm sure. Former Note 7 owners will have a ridiculously easy time getting a Note 8 for WAY cheaper than retail, no matter what they did when they gave back their phones. If not, Samsung is run by idiots.

&gt; A replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 caught fire this morning in Virginia, the fourth known case in the United States in less than a week.

&gt; Shawn Minter got in touch with The Verge after his Note 7 caught fire on his nightstand at 5:45AM. That phone was a replacement he received after returning his recalled Note 7 at a Sprint store in Richmond, Virginia, on September 23rd. &amp;quot;My Galaxy Note 7 replacement phone just burst into flames while on the night stand,&amp;quot; Minter said in an email to The Verge.

&gt; His story, and the pictures, are similar to the others we&amp;#039;ve seen this week, including one that caught fire on Tuesday in Kentucky, one that caught fire on a Southwest Airlines flight, and a third on Friday that caught fire in the hands of a 13-year old girl.

3270,"Same scenario/experience here.

Last Saturday, after receiving the ""Power Down Now"" email, I went to a local T-Mobile store to exchange. Very smooth process with the staff, grabbed the V10 out of curiosity, as my last five or six phones have been Samsung. 

The V10 had some cool features (removable battery, dual screen, minimal bloat), but there were far too many quirks compared to the Note 7. Also, when the devices were sitting side by side on the counter at the store, the aesthetic differences really stood out. My silver Note 7 was a gorgeous masterpiece of art while the V10 was very utilitarian. Which of itself is fine, I'm cool with function over form.

Four issues in particular, however, ended up being deal-breakers:

1. The auto brightness on the V10 is all or nothing. If you increase the slider while auto is checked, you are also turning off the auto feature. Odd. On Samsung devices, you can bump up the brightness a few notches while still having auto remain in effect. Possible that I just didn't delve into the options deeply enough to find a solution, but I played with this phone A LOT and found nothing about auto brightness settings.

2. Contrary to the experience of /u/whythehellknot, I was much slower unlocking the V10. No question due to my ineptitude, not the software, yet still annoying. Freely admit this was my own unfamiliarity with the V10, and not enough of an issue to dump the device.

3. Lack of waterproofing. I cycle with my phone stowed in a pocket in my jersey, and love not having to worry about rain. Carrying a few ziplock baggies is the solution, but it's nice to not fret over sweat and/or rain. The pro of a removable battery almost negates this con, but not quite (for me at least).

4. The final straw was very strange, and no idea what the cause could be. I opened the Kindle app to resume a book I was reading, and on every page the upper 1/3 of the screen had a grayish/dark hue. Not enough to obscure the print by any means, yet quite noticeable. Assuming it was the Kindle app, I pulled up a different book in the Google Play Books app. Same discoloration as the Kindle app, on every page and every book I opened. No occurrence of this phenomenon on web pages, just with books.

Luckily I still had my Note 5, as I hadn't yet sent it back to T-Mobile after jumping to the Note 7. I'll just use it until the replacements are sent out.

BTW, not hating on the V10 at all; most of my experience was likely my fault, and had I given the V10 more of a chance than 2 days I would have learned to love it.

**TL;DR:** Tried the LG V10, anxiously awaiting re-release of Note 7

3328,"I know and that's why folks are jumping ship unfortunately.  In my opinion the part that says ""If we (SAMSUNG) conclude a safety issue exists, (THEN) we will work with the CPSC to take immediate steps to address the situation."" *I added the words in parentheses to make a point that it looks like if there's another recall it would all be in the CPSC ballpark to do so.  Because, this time I don't perceive that Samsung would deem this ONE incident a ""Consumer Safety Issue"", so CPSC would have to mandate a total recall which could take a little more time than the last ""voluntary"" recall since it will involve some legal proceedings similar to ones for ""Orders to Show Cause"" to cease and desist due to a public safety issue.  I might as well get out my popcorn maker now.   :) 


EDIT:  Just want to add that if the CPSC decides to force a recall, I believe the main force behind it would be Airline Safety and the pressure it's receiving from the FAA.  If the FAA is on the verge of considering some action (through whatever channels they need to go through) to ban these phones from airline carriers operating in the USA, then it will affect a lot of travelers.

The Note 7 got a huge amount of attention (and rightfully so, Samsung fucked up) for the initial recall and fires.  That means that if anything happens it is going to be mainstream news.  There are tons of phones which catch fire each year for various reasons.  We're carrying dense batteries in our pocket and aren't that gentle with them.  Faults like this will happen.

I would have rather they gave us a temporary loaner (for people that don't have backups, Note 5, Note 4, S7 Edge are all viable options) or credit for people who do until they figured out why the Note 7's have this problem when the S7's don't, and implemented the changes despite the cost.  I imagine it's cheaper than destroying millions of phones that they already sold and had to pay back.

Even I, who never cared for Apple or the iPhone see myself creeping towards abandoning ship because there is no real alternative to what the Note 7 was approaching - and I hate even saying it.

For starters, early adopters who both bought the original phones AND went through a replacement process already should be given an S7 Edge for free - immediately. This would at least stem the defectors which is going to hurt them a lot more in the long run. But note (no pun intended), they need to understand this is a step BACK for most of us who waited a lot of months and passed on the S7 Edge purposefully in anticipation of the Note 7. This will not feel good - even if free.

Next year, those S7 Edge phones should be able to be traded in for their full value towards an Note 8 or subsequent 8 Edge when available, at our discretion. This way they assuage a loyal base to stay with them (again) towards a more successful phone iteration which they did not get with the Note 7 and which they have waited for a whole other year.

If they want their customers, they HAVE to show they VALUE their customers. If they are going to think company first, they will DAMAGE their company first and people will just walk away rather than bother with their indecision and apathy.

What that means is that your old Note 7s are indeed banned from use during flight, but the replacement Note 7s are perfectly legal to use on planes. It also means that, should any future product be recalled due to lithium battery problems they are already covered under the existing ban.

&gt; Another replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has caught fire, this one in Houston, Texas.

&gt; For it&amp;#039;s part, Samsung has issued a statement saying it is investigating the fires, though it has yet to determine that a &amp;quot;Product safety issue exists.&amp;quot; It&amp;#039;s possible that Samsung is letting US regulators take the lead on the investigation after it was criticized for launching its initial recall of the Note 7 without going through the CPSC. &amp;quot;We are working diligently with authorities and third party experts and will share findings when we have completed the investigation,&amp;quot; said a Samsung spokesperson in a statement to The Verge.

&gt; Until we get more information, the simplest explanation is the best one: The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is a fundamentally defective product and it should be pulled from the market without delay.

&gt; Samsung is preparing to announce a massive and global recall of its brand new Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, according to South Korea&amp;#039;s Yonhap News Agency.

&gt; Yonhap claims that Samsung is currently in discussions with carriers that have already launched the Note 7 - Verizon Wireless is mentioned by name - about how the recall process will be handled.

&gt; This unnamed Samsung official told Yonhap that the battery issue impacts less than 0.1 percent of Note 7 devices sold thus far, but clearly the company is unwilling to take chances.

There is only one ""remedies"" available and that is to return our Note7 for an inferior phone and get a $25 credit that will show up on my T-Mobile bill 2 months later, if at all. 

They have put consumers in danger, not once but twice, and we paid almost $1,000 to have the phone potentially explode in our face. I used up so much of my time talking to T-Mobile over the phone, driving to a T-Mobile store to get a loaner and one more time for the exchange, using Smart Switch twice already, setting up all my IM apps and social apps twice, and spending at least $100 in accessories that I cannot return because I did not buy them at T-Mobile. Why did I have to do all these stuff when I forked out $1,000+? And the only compensation they gave was $25... Despite all this, I was going to return it for a S7 Edge (an 8 months old phone), but lo and behold, I read T-Mobile doesn't even carry the only color I would accept, which is the Black Onyx. 

I don't care how ""unfortunate"" Samsung is or I'm making too big of a deal about this, but Samsung's response is a slap in the face and I hope they come up with a definite plan to compensate the consumers who had suffered and stuck by them during this whole ordeal.

3641,"I went to two Verizon Store yesterday, not authorized retailer.  The first was in the mall in Lynnwood WA and the store manager said I have to bring everything in (charger, cord, earbuds) and she could give me a loaner. I didn't have my crap with me so went to store across the street.

The CSR person who checked me in knew what was going on and said they would switch me with any phone I wanedt.  It was basically a 100% refund and repurchase or whatever device I wanted with signing of new contract agreement. To get to this point, they had to find corporate emails and talked to two different managers... Only with promptings from the CSR who checked me in did the guy who was actively helping me find the right info.  I am now using S7E.  No more cooking pot next to my bed. 

So go to store, say Verizon recalling note 7.  Have them annotate the phone as note 7 recall.  Get a new device, have them annotate it as note 7 replacement.   When new N7 drops, you get to return your temp device for 100% refund with no restocking fee.

3828,"I started experiencing some performance issues myself. Granted, I've been installing a plethora of apps just to see what works best with my new phone. That being said I really got annoyed this morning at how sluggish the phone became that I really thought about alternatives.

However, I constantly run into the same problems. Every other phone while it may have good performance is missing other features that are important to me. I had a Nexus 6P and I hated the finger print scanner on the back and the fact that it has no wireless charging. I also had Wi-Fi issues with every nexus I owned including the Nexus 5. It was so unreliable. I also hated not having a restart option and not being able to buy the phone on JOD with TMobile. I also looked into the One Plus 3 and saw that it too lacks wireless charging and does not have Ok Google always listening like the Nexus (I know that's not on the Note but if I'm going to go for more of a stock feel that I expect that feature). I also found out that the One Plus 3 doesn't do Wi-Fi calling on T-Mobile.

It just seems like there are tons of trade-offs for every phone. But there are so many wins for the Note 7. I love the S-Pen, the AOD, Samsung Pay (x10), Iris Scanner (yes I use it), Camera, wireless charging, edge features, design, actual buttons (dislike on screen navigation buttons), the way it handles bluetooth and more that I'm sure I'm forgetting.

I guess I just don't see any viable alternatives and so the Note 7 wins even with its issues.",2016-08-22 08:31:14,The Note 7(SD variant) Still Delivers Embarrassing Real-World Performance

I work with devices and test a lot of them and throughout testing I've always liked the look of the samsungs best but then they would crash, freeze, heat up and slow down the most of all phones.

I was prepared to put that down to older tech, android not being quite ready or whatever and note7 looked like it would be the one where everything comes together - then this comes out.

If it performs poorly and has bad OS, it cannot be considered the best or closest to the best. Performance is everything.

3851,"So, as with a PC, lowering resolution will require less work and your frame rate will go up. HOWEVER if the phone is spec'd to only run at 60hz (essentially 60fps) then going over 60 in terms of frame rate will not do much in terms of making a game looking smoother.

It will yield a (significant?) savings in battery life either way as the GPU won't be taxed as hard to run the game.

Running at 720p for simple tasks like just browsing the internet or sending messages won't see as high a yield and due to that probably isn't worth it since unless you're really going to push the GPU, most of your battery juice will be sucked up by the data connections, behind the scenes processes, and the large screen. Just because you're gong from 1440p to 720p doesn't mean any of those pixels turn off, so the screen will still be powering 1440p panels worth of pixels. So it comes down to not really taxing the GPU either wa

tl;dr for gaming yes you'll probably see battery savings and but probably not see the games become that much smoother unless they were just too demanding for the Note 7 at native resolution, in day to day things outside of gaming you're just giving yourself a worse viewing experience to save a very small amount of power.

3918,"Ayyy, I'm in the same boat, from Victoria and have a Telus locked note 7. Did the online exchange thing and still haven't received an email yet. It's been 24 hrs.

3920,"I have a few questions and I was hoping someone or some people can answer it. I am on TELUS and my dad bought me the Galaxy Note 7 on August 30th since my contract with my old phone, the Galaxy S3 mini, had expired. On a side note, I live in Brampton, Ontario, Canada and I am on a corporate plan on TELUS with my dad, so hopefully that makes things a little more clear for anyone. Anyways, the phone was on back order when my dad paid for it so I thought ""whatever I might get it within a week or two"", but three days later on September 2nd, we heard about the recall. On a related note, my dad got an email from TELUS stating that, because of the battery issue, it would take within 30 days for the phone to be shipped out and arrive to my house.

Basically a little over two week later, on September 16th, I noticed on some websites that many people in Canada have already received a replacement as early as September 15th, while others would have to wait until the week of September 19th for the Note 7 to be shipped or arrive at the person's front door. I find this a little annoying because I was quite excited to get the Galaxy Note 7 but mine has not arrived yet and it has been nearly three weeks since the phone was initially ordered. 

So my questions are: is there a likely chance that I might get the Note 7 on September 19th or sometime that week? Would UPS be the one shipping it to me? (I noticed that UPS has shipped things to my house in the past but I am unsure if they would ship it or FedEx would be the one shipping it to me), since I have someone staying home on the 19th of September, should I get that person to sign for the package or should I not go to college and stay home that day so I can sign for it? Also, how would I be able to tell that the Note 7 I get is safe compared to the ones that were recalled? Also, how soon would the Note 7 arrive to my house?

I do apologize for the numerous questions and extremely wordy paragraphs. Any help would greatly be appreciated and I will keep everyone up-to-date on information as I receive it. ",2016-09-18 22:54:20,Just Got My replacement phone From Samsung Canada with a list of drop off locations.

3947,"I was going to wait until new Note7's were available, but I dropped my phone and the touchscreen no longer worked along with some cracks on the screen. I took just the phone, no accessories, into my local corporate Verizon and the first thing they asked for was the accessories. They said they wouldn't take it back unless I had everything that was in the original box, which luckily I brought with me just for this very reason. They then realized the phone didn't even work and at first refused to take it back. After some back and forth with the manager, he made a call to his boss and got the ok to exchange it. They then tried to tell me I could only exchange it for another Samsung device, which I wanted to switch to Apple. They refused to give me anything besides another Samsung device so I left in frustration. I went home and went onto the Verizon website and used the chat option. Within 15 minutes, they shipped me out a replacement iPhone and a return label to return the Note7.

4036,"this is what I got from Twitter after messaging tmo

The Note 7 is a beautiful phone and we are working hard with Samsung to make sure they will be available to purchase as soon as possible. 
As you probably know, we have had to recall all of the Note 7's that we had previously sold, and at the moment we are placing priority on giving those customers who have had to return their devices a chance to get a new one. As soon as we have available inventory from Samsung we will resume sales on the Note 7 immediately. Unfortunately we don't have an exact date at this time because we are still waiting to see how much of our inventory will need to be earmarked for customers exchanging their Note 7's. 
My personal recommendation is to start watching the website (http://t-mobile.com ) after 9/21 to see when it is listed for sale there. As soon as you see it available, we will be able to get yours to you. I wish I had a more concrete answer for you with this. I want you to be able to upgrade when you're ready. Hopefully it won't be long until the device is in stock again. Let me know if you have any other questions or if I can help with anything else.

I'm actually quite happy with the Pixel XL.  I wish I still had my Note 7, but well, yeah.

Pros so far:

- Incredibly fast and smooth.  I thought the Note 7 was plenty smooth, but this is another level.

- Better audio.  The speaker is much louder and clearer.  Headphone and auxillary use gets louder while maintaining quality.  In my car, I had to crank my stereo up to 25 with the Note 7, while with the Pixel I'm at 18. (yeah, the actual number means nothing, but it's relative).

- Battery life.  Everyone uses their phone differently, but I've gotten more SoT out of the Pixel so far.  I'm finishing my day now, at 15%, with 7hr 21min SoT and 15 hr off charge.  With the Note 7 I could get that, but I'd have to scale the resolution down to 1080p.

Your customer reference number is 2119492112
 
I am contacting you regarding your Note 7 device and to advise that, Samsung can replace your device whilst you are in the UK with a new UK Samsung, single SIM Note 7 device in black or blue. Before we go ahead and process the exchange, we would require the serial and IMEI number of the device and a UK contact number if you have one, we would also require the place of purchase of the Note 7 device. Once we have captured all these relevant details we would then raise the exchange and arrange for our logistics team to contact you directly to arrange the exchange at your home address where they would swap the devices.
 
 
If you require additional support please contact us on 0330 726 1010 (UK), or respond to this email and I will be more than happy to help.

As far as I understand, its not the matter of who made the battery,
let me try to explain if i can... :s

So, for all android galaxy phones, Samsung SDI is in charge of the battery, and Samsung SDI have subcontract with a Chinese company named ""DongGuang"".    (SO Samsung SDI is responsible for this issue, but from what I read,  they are trying to blame the subcontracted company) Its one of those Korean ""thing"" of figuring out who to blame, instead of admitting the problem and apologizing. 
 
Samsung SDI makes and provides ""Battery Cell"" to DongGuang and their job is to ""Package"" the battery with their technology of protecting the phone, and all sort of stuff i don't understand... So ALL Note 7 have potential to explode. ",2016-09-01 03:01:50,Note 7 explosion update 2

Clean reliable energy could power the entirety of the world with minimal investment, all we have to do is refocus the spending away from fossil fuels and put them towards solar farms. This is especially true in regions that have large desert areas, because what else are you going to do with that land? It's uninhabitable, you can't farm on it, it's literally just sat there getting an unobstructed view of the sun...  I mean, come on guys, what's the holdup? If a smaller desert country did this sort of thing now they'd be a global superpower within 10 years!

I think it is a convenient thing to have right on the home screen, but it's more there to take up space than because I wanted *that* specific widget. It felt weird having the gap between folders and the time. I have another wallpaper that I am going back and forth on as well. It looks awesome with this screen, but I like the bit of color on the one I have in the screenshot, where the other one is just black and white.

Anyway, Nova launcher (beta), swipe up for apps, down for settings, tap home button once for Samsung Notes app. Hold for Google functions (it is possible that is a Samsung feature and not a Nova feature, but I don't remember 100% right now how I found it).

*""All returns/exchanges/refunds of all items has to be done within 7 days from date of purchase provided that item and packaging are unused and unopened.""*

I don't expect them to refund, I just ask if I could exchange to another version of their case. Even a coupon code would have been fine.

I been using their cases since 3 years ago, no more from now on.

No, I did not buy from Amazon, only from their official website.

4706,"I wanted to just replace mine at T-Mobile, but the phone colors they have a gold and silver. Seriously, I don't like either one.  So I visited samsung.com and they had a link to Walmart. So I ordered one from Walmart. I don't know the model numbers, but what I got was an SM-G935F.

Several things I learned very quickly:
1) The phone signal in my house sucked compared to the S6 and Note7 (both T-Mo), so I'm guessing frequency support varies... I don't know.
2) Samsung Pay is not supported
3) Wi-Fi calling isn't supported, as you noted; I generally don't use this, but I do when I travel internationally and it's absolutely wonderful to be able to call family back home at no charge
4) The always-on display is not nearly as good at the Note7 ... Note7 is awesome.

So, I just reset the phone and plan to return it to Walmart.  It's not a bad device, but issues 1-3 are three reasons to just get one designed for T-Mobile.

Like an idiot, I guess, I went back to Samsung.com -- where all my problems started with the Note7 -- and ordered a new S7 Edge for T-Mobile.

I don't like the S7E. I like the S7 but it feels small. I like the Note5 but feels now like a step back (an 800$ step back). For the Pixel, I don't like stock Android ( and especially a 1000$ stock Android). LG has the loop issues. And I will not grab an Apple phone. Ever. 

I have a phone budget for each 2 years and I wanted the Note7 and it deserved the 1000$ price here in Canada. I was happy even though it was at the end 200$ over my budget.

&gt; If you happen to run into a Note 7 unit from the original batch, don&amp;#039;t take any chances and go through the recall process - the small nuisance is definitely worth the peace of mind of knowing your device won&amp;#039;t just set itself aflame without warning.

&gt; Customers can still bring their recalled Note7 or the new replacement Note7, along with accessories they purchased from T-Mobile, to a T-Mobile store for a full refund and choose from any device in T-Mobile&amp;#039;s inventory.

&gt; To help offset any additional costs our customers may have incurred throughout this process, anyone who returns their recalled Note7 will automatically receive a one-time $25 credit on their T-Mobile bill within two bill cycles.

They use a positive electrode and negative electrode, the charge moves in one direction when charging and the other when discharging. When charging, the external electrical source must apply a higher voltage than is produced by the battery, in order to switch the direction of the current from discharge to charge. I know almost nothing about Samsung's battery construction, but if I had to hazard a guess I would say that the short occurs somewhere in the charging circuit, and is either only electrically exposed to or only reaches a high enough temp/voltage during the charging phase (when it uses over-voltage) to cause the pressurized, flammable electrolyte to ignite.

I just want to forget this ever happened, but Samsung seems to want to have me never forget that my Note7 was a disaster. So why did they do it? I can't decide between:

 * it's a temporary measure so they just don't care how it looks. It will go away once they can declare that all (or the vast majority) of faulty Note7's have been recovered
 * they don't care how the Note7 looks because they have written off the device, they expect so few sales of it that they are just moving on to the S8.

OTOH, for a camera that's probably going to take pictures primarily for social media, it does a great job in  brightly lit scenes when downscaled to 1/4 or 1/8 resolution. I just wished there were more night/evening photos to see how it does with less light.

i am literally looking at alternatives that most would consider technological brilliance and shrugging in disgust.

though i can't say i'm surprised; i was amazed that the replacements were arriving in stores within ten days of the first recall; i had a feeling something would go sideways.  and i likewise feel like there must be something we aren't being told.

i can only hope they figure it out, rebrand, and put it out again within a year, because this phone was absolutely top notch.  even the size and weight of it were *perfect*.  when i had the S7E loaner, it felt impotent in my hand, like a tiny flaccid dick.  and this was a critic darling until the N7 came out!

5532,"If you want a note 7 you should get one.  The battery issue is so unlikely to happen statistically.  You're being driven by fear and sensationalism.  If you're happy with your iPhone then stick with it.  Otherwise remember there are more than 2 companies making phones.  I like the note because of the pen and display.  Otherwise I'd probably get a lgv20, despite people's comments about boot looping.   Just find what you like,if there's an issue down the road then deal with it using the options available.  It's like a 1 in 4,000 chance you will get into an accident when you drive, does that stop you from driving?

5533,"I have owned many Samsung phones. Fascinate, Droid Charge, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S3, Note 2, Note 3, Note 4, Note 5 and the Note 7. I am so annoyed with Samsung, I am probably not going to purchase another one of their products. I still have a $900 paperweight that has not been replaced. I am sure I am not alone. I am the guy that my coworkers and friends ask for advice about phones. I am not recommending Samsung phones.

5534,"Being a replacement Note 7 owner (after S7, after original Note 7 owner), I was pretty damn vocal about my displeasure in a couple other threads about this.

The reasons are:

* Fear and uncertainty about my eyeballs getting burned out of my head like Sarah Connor's.

* I wasted roughly 14 hours of my time setting up new phones, talking with T-mobile, dropping off packages at UPS, waiting at the T-mobile store for my replacement, etc.

* A few days of wasted productivity while my phone was powered down.

* Samsung PR sucks. They should have been, like, ""Sorry. We truly fucked up. Here, here's $100 credit.""

What did I get for all my troubles? All I got was a ""free"" replacement. But the hassle I went through was left unaddressed.

Yeah, I know, first world problems. Well I'm looking for first world solutions.

I can, which is why I have a portable external DAC/AMP connected to my devices which significantly improve sound-stage, noise floor, clarity, and power (as the S7e is highly under-powered for headphones like the Fostex T50RP Mk.III)

5644,"Ok.  Here is an update.

I went to the Verizon store and after some back and forth with the staff and the manager they processed an s7 edge as an upgrade.  They told me because I can't turn in my Note 7 I will be charged.  

I told them to bring on the charges as I will bring on a small claims suit for my money.  I called customer service they hemmed and hawed and said they'll try to process it as a lost/stolen phone.  But since my bill cycle doesn't end until the 10th, I'm going to have to wait and see.  Additionally, the Verizon staff at the store told me the $100 credit from Samsung can only be used on accessories.  I told them that's not gonna happen and the credit needs to be put towards my bill.  They said that's not how it works and if I don't buy the accessories at the time of ""upgrade"" I lose the incentive.  (We'll see about that).

Samsung called me today and had me send them my original receipt for the Note and said they will process a refund for the difference between the two phones. They said they will process this sometime next week.  They sent me an email asking if I incured any other charges as a result of the airport debacle as they would refund those.  I explained I didn't have to spend any extra money, just last 10 hours of my life while on vacation trying to get this all taken care of prior to getting to Florida to no avail.

So as of right now I have an s7 edge which is OK  (it's no Note 7, but it's also not explody).  ",2016-10-24 21:21:36,"TSA now has my phone, Verizon failed to send my replacement, Samsung said tough shit"

I was nervous the whole time I had my phone without any protection for the screen, and I rock my phone without a case as well. But all had gone well until just a day or two ago, I had been on reddit lying on the couch downstairs and I went upstairs to get changed. I walked upstairs put my phone on my wireless fast charger to get little bit of battery before going to the movies. After I finished getting changed, I grabbed my phone off the charger and put it in my gym shorts and went downstairs to go out to the car. Grabbed my keys and wallet and tossed them in the opposite pocket (my phone is the only thing ever in my right pocket) and pulled out my phone to check my texts before getting out when I noticed a crack on the left side of the screen. I have now idea how it could have happened since I'd hear if my phone smacked a wall or something, and plus I'd feel it pull on my gym shorts (deep stretchy pockets). While I have no scratches, I now have a cracked screen on the left side that runs from about the middle of the device down. For this reason and the other concerns with Gorrilla Glass 5 scratching too easily, I think I might just opt for the full refund on my Note 7.  

TL;DR: Note 7 screen cracked in pocket, don't now how, not sure if worth risking it by getting another note or just refunding it and moving on.

5829,"So Samsung is issuing a worldwide recall, working with carriers and major retailers around the world to make sure that everyone can swap out their phone with a new one; but when it comes to ebay resellers, they decided to work closely with random ebay stores and go so far as to say there's no problem at all. Samsung even went above and beyond and verified that the ebay reseller purchased phones from a first production run as well (assuming what they said is accurate, but I have yet to hear anything about the fact that first production line is completely safe).

Sounds like bullshit to me. They're just taking their chances based on the fact that such a low number of phones are known to be affected. I hope they refund you, but if they're spouting BS like this, I wouldn't hold out much hope.",2016-09-06 21:21:13,Response I received from eBay reseller...I hope they won't be a dick and not refund...
5830,"Okay so the US government gets involved, that only means that covers the US. Not the world. As well as the fact that you think it would help, but since it's the government we wouldn't be seeing anything out of them by now.  It's the government, they have to have meetings to discuss what they will talk about in meetings. They don't move very fast, since they have to have a meeting about how fast they should move on this, then another meeting to discus the speed of their actions that was talked about in the other meeting.  And unless someone dies, they would take their sweet time in this.  So don't hang your hat on 'it would go much easier if the government was involved' argument. And to top it off nothing says that a company can't do their own recall. That's why it's called a voluntary recall, or voluntary exchange at this point. That means the CPSC didn't tell them they had to do it. Which is why some people are butt hurt, because the CPSC didn't have to tell them how to handle their business. Also just because the government gets involved doesn't mean they would stop being sold.  Heck even Samsung has said it's stopped selling them. Doesn't mean others have.  I think we already know that not everyone follows the law, so one someone would still keep selling them.
So would you rather do business with a company who says 'yep we screwed up, here is what we are doing to make it right'(voluntary recall).  Or a company that says 'what? our products are hurting people. Well piss off we don't care.  Oh so we 'have' to replace our products because you said so. well okay then'(Official recall).
I'm all for the one who accepts responsibility for their actions, without being told to .

I would reply with something that states Samsung did not specify in the recall notice which phones are affected. Feel free to attach the link and recall notice. Clearly reiterate (if you did not in your initial message) what you expect the seller to do. Be firm, but polite. Make them tell you no in writing.

5934,"I really want to keep my note7! I had a note 3 for a few years then opted for the nexus 6 bc it was big and beefy and free of all the bloat. I didn't realize how much I liked Samsung's bloat. I missed so much of what my note 3 did, but I had no choice but to pay down my nexus until the release of this work of art note7. This freaking phone has everything I dreamed of it having and more and now by some divine punishment for abandoning the Samsung brand years ago the good Lord has tested my faith by taking this perfect tool and leaving me no viable option.  So we're left with this .. Hold out as long as possible but I promise Samsung will brick it eventually. Rooting is a option but doing so I am sure u will lose a lot of functionality, it would be the only way I could see being able to avoid the update that turns your joy into a paper weight.  Finally the ultimate sacrifice turn it in😣 but for what? A. The se7, but every time i would look to unlock my phone bc the stupid fingerprint scanner won't read my dry skin I would end up throwing it at the wall causing me great remorse and a bulky otter box b. The pixel xl, back to google?? Idk I really found the nexus6 boring. In fact my wife got the droid turbo also made by Motorola and it's functionality is way better then the nexus 6 so much so that I feel that phone should have sported the google name . But who am I trying to convince here the only real option is the pixel and it seems to be (other then the vr) a real down grade. If I were a conspiracy man I would be wondering how such a perfect phone could flop right before all the lesser phones of the year debut I wonder if Samsung is wondering the same thing (Or maybe there in on it) lol . Maybe the pixel xl will be a hit ! With promise of the assistant following u from device to device and the launch of the Alexa like accessory maybe that will be my saving grace in this nightmare.  I have a feeling im in for a expensive let down and a long wait for my note 7 to drop as the ""whatever they name it "" 8 next year . The things i will miss undoubtabley the most will be in order the iris scanner, the secure folder , the edge, and the pen. I honestly don't use the pen very often but it's freaking great when I need to jot something down . I'm so bummed out, I am going to hold out as long as they let me . The phone is not going to burn up... I would love to know the statistics from what I understand it's a few out of a ton correct me if I'm wrong , im good with those odds for now however i am not going to mod my phone or miss out on a chance to get a full refund.

6265,"Why in the world are you even trolling the Note7 forum if nothing is going to impress you?

**no removable battery**

-This thing charges 50% in 30 minutes, it has 500mah more battery than the previous Note anyways.

-If you are carrying around a battery, cant you just carry around a QC power bank? isn't it pretty much the same thing?

-""Oh but I don't want to wait for it to charge, a removable battery can be popped out and a fresh one in in seconds"" My response to this is get the wireless charging back and snap it on... JUST as quick as replacing a removable battery with minimal bulk.

I mean come-on, there are literally almost no relevant down sides to having a non-removable battery at this stage in the game.

I'd personally much rather have waterproofing and tighter design than a removable battery.

**No IR**

If you really need an IR blaster, get a harmony hub. It is a wifi connected IR blaster that sits by your AV equipment that talks to a TV Remote app on any android or ios phone via wifi. ANY phone can have the equivalent of IR capability using this device, it will even work with hue lighting and other home automation systems, and it will work with any future phone that has wifi so you can stop complaining and worrying about if your next phone will have an IR blaster.


**No FM** -This is incorrect.

Sorry but you are wrong. The Snapdragon 820 versions of galaxy phones DO have FM radio.

The S7 and S7 Edge support FM and the Note7 most likely as well (pending confirmation on this, but it is extremely likely)

I'd love to hear what ""this that and the other"" is that the Note7 is missing.

No phone out there that is currently shipping has a higher spec'ed processor.

We've got the sd card back and the new s-pen is more accurate than ever (I tested it in bestbuy and the finer tip is awesome. It feels like ink is flowing from the tip, and you can write more words per line since the line is thinner.)

I'm afraid of bootloop issues (LG).  Granted, the battery issues are worse, but at least it was all acknowledged and I have a new phone after a complete refund.  Apparently, LG took its sweet time acknowledging the bootloop issues.

I don't like the iPhone ecosystem.

So, where does that leave me in terms of picking non-Samsung phones? 

Next time, I'll be waiting for a phone to be out for a while before I buy it.  And, yes, it will probably be a Samsung (because the other phones don't appeal to me).",2016-10-11 22:04:44,What should Samsung do to win you back?

When I send my Note 7 back, they're going to give me another $315 credit for the cost+tax I paid for the phone. I'll have a net $300 credit on my bill, plus the $25 from the first trade. 
I'm not happy with having to ""waste"" my subsidy on a second rate phone (and, let's face it, compared to the Note 7 they all are), but if the Note 7 had never existed, I'd be in the same boat I was two months ago, just without the option of considering the phones which have been released since then.

I hear ya.  My last phone was an LG V10, which had both features you listed.  I did use the battery swap from time to time, but the IR blaster much less than I thought I would.  It just never felt as nice as a real remote.  My #1 use was in my Dr's office where they played the TV too loud.

6924,"well, most phones do better than the note 7, the harder surface always prevails. I'm going to get the note 7, but definitely with a glass screen protector. The thing with hardness is that if you have steel keys in your pocket with the phone, a normal glass screen would never scratch but the note 7 screen could. 

Copper, nickel, iron , aluminium and steel have a hardness of 3 to 4,5. so those could never scratch an other phone, but could scratch a note 7. imagine everything made from those materials you'd have to be careful of.

The glass has probably been made less hard to get the small curve and shock resistance. as long as the glass screen protectors are any good i'd rather have a broken screen protector than a broken screen. I think this also makes the edge smaller.",2016-08-19 05:57:54,About GG5 Scratching...

It might be the oliophobic layer coating on it, but if you saw some of the dude's videos, it's easier to scratch than $100 Chinese phones.

I'll definitely be going with a screen protector on mine for longevity. Early scratches on my phone will drive me mad for a few years lol.",2016-08-19 03:59:16,About GG5 Scratching...
6928,"Sure, its not the best test for normal everyday use but it gives somewhat of an indication as to what it can take. It failed to hold up to previous models scratch resistance so its more likely that it *can* get scratched up from everyday use or a little accident that might not have affected previous versions. Since I started using glass protectors, I haven't noticed a significant difference from the normal screen and it gives it extra protection and gives me peace of mind, without sacrificing on its looks or feel.

What was weirder was they told me that if I called the 800 number they'd be able to help me. Thinking that was odd, I asked them to note my account, and called the 800 number.  They told me there is no way at all they could process an exchange and my only option was to go into the store, after arguing about how I ordered the phones online in the first place because its very inconvenient for me to get to the store, there was nothing she could do, she even tried calling the store to get them to at least hold two phones for me in the same colors I had - 1 silver, and 1 blue - and the retail store wouldn't do it.  Finally I gave up and said I'd just go into the store.  Customer service gave me a $40 bill credit for my trouble.  BIG DEAL, I spend $5,000 a year with them!   So I backed up my phones, did factory resets on both, took all the accessories out of the box and pulled the s-pens, put the phones in the boxes and went to the retail store.    Was a 20 minute wait to be helped, during which time I cringed hard when I overheard one of the employees tell another customer they ""weren't eligible"" to exchange their phone.  That customer looked like he was about to murder everyone in the store - after a 5 minute hushed conference with his manager, the employee came back and was able to process the exchange for the guy.  Finally it was my turn, a nice young lady, went into the back, came out with 2 new phones in the proper colors, processed my exchanges, swapped my sim cards, I told her I already wiped the phones and I would set them up myself at home so she put my new phones back in their brand new boxes with all accessories and I was out the door.  35 minutes in all, including the 20 minute wait.

Simple reasoning - the LED is so bright on the Samsung devices they can light up a room at night. I get sick of waking up to a blinking blue light.

Is a process called ""imsd"" using 25% cpu all the time?  This process's CPU usage gets counted as part of Android System...  You need to run this test when the phone has been booted up for hours and is having the battery drain issue, as the battery drain problem tends to go away for a few hours after a reboot.

http://i.imgur.com/0fcNito.png

For me, the phone would be fine for maybe 2-3 hours after rebooting, but once a little time had passed that imsd process would start using CPU (25% means it is using 100% of a single core) and once that happened the phone would be laggy, hot, and have terrible battery life.

Pretty much everyone I've heard of with issues that sound like the same issue are on T-Mobile (including myself), and I see you are too.

The issue kept happening even after multiple factory resets, and even with no apps installed at all, and even in safe mode.  I never was able to fix it and ended up returning for a refund.

And dirt got under them eventually. It wasn't too noticeable since it was the very corner, but still. I think it might have been my particular screen protector because my family has two S7e phones with the Skinomi case-friendly screen protector and Caseology cases, and no problems with peeling corners.

For my replacement Note7 I bought the ArmourSuit case-friendly screen protector. No problems whatsoever with it sticking to the edges/corners or peeling up, but it has a more noticeable texture than the Skinomi one, despite being much thinner. Not a dealbreaker for me, but might be for some. Texture does not interfere with S-Pen use, though it does leave slight marks on the protector, which go away after a bit of time. I haven't tried switching the pen nib from grey to white because, frankly, I am lazy, but it might help.

That said, I think just because you're having a negative experience doesn't cancel out the fact that other people also are having negative experiences, even if in your perception we have it better. I must have spent at least five hours over the last week with customer service, then ended up going to three different stores before I could find one with the black onyx in stock...an hour away from my house. Verizon wouldn't process the exchange for me over the phone and the stores weren't picking up calls (because they were so busy dealing with customers exchanging Note 7s/buying iPhones) so I couldn't just call ahead and ask if they had any. I didn't receive any additional gifts (I only have my free SD card from when the recalled original phone) and I didn't get to keep a second set of accessories. My case wasn't *too* bad, but I've definitely read some horror stories of people trying to exchange their devices.

All that to say: we're not all getting a bunch of extra freebies, and many of us have had to spend a lot of time and gas actively trying to get through this exchange process. 

I understand you're just ranting here, which is fair enough, and I guess I needed to get a little rant out too.

As an aside, I found it funny your brother suggested the iPhone - mine did, too, and I actually pre-ordered it at my most dire moment of frustration with Samsung/Verizon. Thankfully, I came to my senses and realized I shouldn't downgrade just because I was emotional haha.

1)  First phone data didn't work.  Guy thought SIM card was bad, swapped a bunch of them, none worked.  Thought phone was bad.  I had to go through another data transfer to a second phone, still nothing.  Ended up the data plan was ""removed"" from my account ""somehow"" and so they had to re-add it by calling at&amp;t customer support.  
2)  Some app data did not transfer via Smart Switch nor via Samsung Backup.  Lost all accounts (have to manually add them), some settings in apps are gone, wifi settings, OS settings like font size/blue filter/icon frames/keyboard choice and settings/quick switch layout/nfc settings... I could go on and on. not restored.
3)  Theme was lost, have to find the theme I was using.

Battery icon isn't green yet (I'm not up to speed on that, maybe it's not released yet or something).  

Overall a pretty annoying experience.  I might expect this experience going between phone models, but not between the same phone.  

I didn't get to keep my s-pen though I tried, the fellow looked for it and asked for it.  I did get to keep all my accessories as I didn't bring those, so I got a new set (the least they could do for this hassle).

7917,"1. Switched to the Note 7 from an iPhone 6 when the Note 7 launched in Canada. 
2. You can pretty much use the Note 7 as a stand-alone phone. I could be wrong but you'll need at least one Google account so that you can access the Google Play Store so you can get apps. 
Google doesn't have an equivalent of iTunes desktop application. Android phones sync and backup directly to cloud-based services. I'm pretty sure there are third-party programs that you can buy to do this though. 
I don't think you need to provide a credit card to use the Play Store unless you need to buy an app that's not free. 
3. iOS is not necessarily better than Android. Android is not necessarily better than iOS. This is the us versus them mentality of fanboys and fangirls. 
No, Android phones are not always buggy. 
The quality and feature set of some apps are different. There are many factors why this so. On a day to day basis, you'll probably just learn to live with it. 
Some app developers are iOS only or iOS first. For the most part though, the mainstream apps are available on both platforms with the same feature set. 
Android allows developers more control on what their apps can do. Take Pushbullet. It's so lame on iOS but incredibly useful on Android. 
4. I can't speak authoritative regarding this. But I'd say yes, an iPhone will probably hold more of its price after 2 years.
Bottom line. As an iPhone user since the original iPhone, I would recommend the Note 7 to potential switcher who is tech savvy enough. I switched because A) the Note 7 is just so damn beautiful to look at, B) the iPhone has in my opinion plateued in terms of style and innovation and C) Android and iOS phones pretty much do the same thing nowadays. ",2016-09-17 06:07:42,iOS user considering to switch to Note 7!
7918,"I switched from a 6+ after primarily using iPhones since 2008. Since then, I've been on-and-off with other devices, but my iPhone was always my main device. After finally leaving iPhones, I have zero regrets.

1) Yes. It's nice to have full control over everything. With the iPhone, you have to use the device HOW APPLE TELLS YOU TO. With Android, you can use it HOW **YOU** WANT TO.

2) You'll need a Google account to install apps, however you can install them manually via their APK files. I actually never thought about setting my device up like this. Updating apps probably isn't as easy that way, however.

3) It should be fine, especially if you're more of a light user. There may be more frequent OS updates with iOS, but honestly, unless they fix an issue you're having, I don't see the updates as useful anyway.

4) After observing Swappa pricing, Android phones *definitely* lose a lot of their value within the first year (if not within the first 6 months) compared to iPhones. That's just the way it is, unfortunately. I got more for my 2-year-old 6+ than a newer Note 5.",2016-09-17 23:38:12,iOS user considering to switch to Note 7!

7921,I've used androids and iPhones off and on. Neither is really shitty so long as you get a good android phone. The only thing I want to address is -vresale valu4 - definitely lower and I would expect a note 7 to have the lowest of any high end android phone ever due to the secondary market having no inclination to verify they are not recalled units.,2016-09-17 17:05:24,iOS user considering to switch to Note 7!
7922,"1. I left my iPhone 6plus for a S6 Edge+,  and now have a note 7. Will not be going back to iPhone. Mind you I have had the original iPhone,  3g, 4, 5, 5s, and 6plus. The edge+ was my first android. 

2. Yes and no, I already have payment info synced on my Gmail,  but you can also use PayPal.  

3. This was true before, but one thing you have to accept with the note 7 is the added software come with consequences. My edge+ was snappy for the whole year,  even after the MM update. The note 7 is snappy as well,  and gets better with a few minor tweaks in the settings. 

4. I cannot answer this as I haven't sold my edge+,  and gave my girlfriend since she broke her iPhone 6 plus. She not tech savvy herself,  and she's enjoyed learning all the different tricks and customization features she can now do. She doesn't care to have another iPhone. ",2016-09-16 22:45:42,iOS user considering to switch to Note 7!
7923,"How does Apple force users to become reliant on the iPhone?  Syncing with iTunes is vastly superior to the basically nothing that Google provides.  Trust me, Android backup and sync sucks donkey ass.  I've used iPhones for years and Android devices for years, I'm on a Note 5 and believe, nothing beats syncing through iTunes.  When you purchase a movie through Apple, you have a downloaded copy on your computer through iTunes.  When you purchase a movie through Google, you do not.  If you run out of space on your Android device and want to sync a movie, you have to download it, which takes longer than syncing through iTunes. 

And if you think that the iPhone is ""shitty"" because ""nothing has changed since the iPhone 6"" you really need to understand that yes, the case and body are pretty much the same but much inside has changed.  You could say the same thing about the Galaxy line.  It's shitty because nothing really changed from the S5 to the S6 to the S7 because the cases and bodies look pretty much the same, excluding the Edge variants.

Much of the differences I notice between iOS and Android are the apps.  For instance, the twitter and reddit clients on Android are exponentially better than any on iOS.  As for other apps like calendars and GTD apps, Android offers complete shit compared to what's on Android.  NOTHING compares to Things or Omnifocus.  And NOTHING on Android compares to iMessages.  Nothing.  

I switched from an iPhone 6 Plus to a Nexus 6 which broke, now I'm on a Note 5.  I do plan on getting a Note 7 soon, though.

As for resale value, yes iPhones hold the value longer, simply because IMHO it's an overall better phone.  The Note 5 was about 800 or so when it launched, I paid 400 for mine a year later.  People sell the iPhone 6s Plus for only a hundred or so less than what they paid for it new.

But I do love both platforms, there are pluses and minuses in each.

Uh oh, there's someone who isn't saying iTard and sheep who likes both platforms.  Everyone, down vote!  We can't have someone who isn't a rabit anti apple android fanboy here.",2016-09-17 08:19:48,iOS user considering to switch to Note 7!
7924,"I've never owned an iphone myself only andriod from way back. You are the 1st iphone user I've heard say the iphone 7 is ""shitty"" and a carry over from the 6 series. Interesting to the say the least...

I can only answer 2)., which is no. You don't have to enter credit card info to use the google play store (Android version of app store). If you want to buy an app you will be asked for credit card info, but its not tied to syncing.  Syncing of contacts, pictures etc happens via your gmail account. Which is nice because they can be accessed from any computer, if you find yourself without your phone. 

I can say in the years I have been buying Android phones the note 7 is by far the most aesthetically pleasing Android phone I have used. It really does rival the iphone design. Now that the battery issue has been taken care of I think its a great choice if you're on the fence.

The person I got was unable to confirm and said they'd call me by the end of the afternoon once they spoke with the original rep. Didn't hear anything and called once again. This rep checked with a supervisor who told them to reattempt the order - I was to receive a confirmation within two hours, which I did not get. I called once again and this rep claimed that I wouldn't receive a confirmation for at least 48 hours. I pointed out that the temps have overnight shipping, to which they replied that it'll be shipped overnight in 48 hours and that I wouldn't get my temp before the weekend (during my two orders I was told it would). At this point I said fuck this and asked for the supervisor to make sense of this bullshit and they were able to place the order, send the e-mail, and confirm everything while I was on with her.

Notably, Samsung has an opt-out provision where you can opt-out of this agreement and take them to court if necessary. This is important because should your phone cause damage to you or your possessions, opting out gives you a remedy in court as an individual plaintiff or member of a class.

I changed a few things, like the ""buttons"" on the bottom to apps that I use, like Facebook instead of Google +. I also changed the music player to PowerAMP instead of Spotify. I'm also going to change some of the images to something sexy, like kpop idols or something. =P Cuz I'm horrible that way.

If you decide to buy KLWP, there's a whole [community](https://plus.google.com/communities/105800766530390603634) full of really good looking stuff. Hasn't eaten much battery, either (well, the setup has, but not the daily usage).

You can also search the play store for KLWP themes and there are some great ones (and packs) that you can get, some for money, though.

Edit: Just be aware that it requires some tinkering around to set up a theme if you're new to it, moreso than simply downloading a new theme. Even the ones you buy you need to set them up, and some themes may require other apps to work. Mine didn't require anything except PowerAMP, which I already had. You can change them, too. For example, if you want to use Google Calendar instead of stock. But it requires you to dig through the app a bit. There's lots of help if you google it though.

The note 7 perfected the curve. Versus the s7 edge you get random presses if you use your phone without a case. A case can counter most of the accidental presses if not all.

I was assured when placing my pre-order on Tuesday that it would be available as of open on release day. What is the point of getting a pre-order if it isn't ready in time for release? I'm about to go to the store on my lunch break to see if I can get some answers. I'm with Verizon, for what it's worth.

Edit: finally got a person on the line who didn't place me on hold. Apparently my store is also waiting on their shipment to come in. Better than no answer at all, but I'm still pretty annoyed.

Edit 2: still no email indicating phone is ready. No answer when calling into the store. Guess I'm going to have to wait and call first thing tomorrow morning.

Edit 3: I got fed up and called the customer service line. It took me 59:36 to reach a person, but he was very pleasant and very much seemed like he wanted to help. He checked the status of my order and looked into the location I'm supposed to be picking up from, and said that they never received the shipment that was supposed to fulfill their pre-orders. The best part? That shipment was due to arrive yesterday, and still didn't today apparently. He said that Best Buy is working with Samsung and the shipping companies to try to get shipments to come in over the weekend and into early next week for many of their stores, since so many didn't receive enough/any stock. He also said that since we are now past the date of release, an employee at the store will be calling me to let me know when the phone is ready to be picked up.

Actually, it has a bigger battery too, so there is an upside I suppose. I can't complain. It does seem to be a bit snappier than the Note 7, as others have said. I'll be completely fine with this as long as they let me get the Note 8 without losing payments on this phone and instead transfer the payments onto the Note 8 (which is what it sounds like they are doing in Korea.)

Then eventually they tell me to call the store I bought it from. Then the store tells me to call one of the numbers that I've called before.

I bought the device directly from Samsung (Retail store.) 

Eventually the liars in the executive department said they'd replace the device. They said they'd call me in 48-72 hours with tracking info for the new device. That time passed a long time ago and still no response.

Now i'm dealing with someone on Facebook who is trying to resolve the issue.

On top of all this, (why I came to the the sub in the first place today) the device just dropped from like 80% power to 15 percent in the space of 1 second. Then it dropped from 15% 20 13 percent in the space of 1 minute. Then it died. Shut off without shutting down.

I'm in a government building, so I'm gonna plug it in to charge. I hope it catches on fire. That should be fun. I took a screenshot of the battery stats, i'll upload them once i have some power.

I apologize greatly. They have updated us with information that FedEx and UPS are now agreeing to transport the packages again, but only if we get special packaging (I would assume flame retardant?) that we will have to issue to the customers to use to return the phones. Once this packaging is available, they hope to be able to get those sent in and refunds issued to the customers. We just got this information this morning.

8806,"I had the S7E as a temp after the first recall and really disliked it. Just the way it felt and the slight differences from the Note 7. The edge was too much and too sensitive, I was constantly activating it. 

I went with the v20 after the 2nd recall and vastly prefer it over the S7E. This is obviously my personal opinion cause I used the v10 before and I just love using the DAC at work. It feels better in the hand, removable battery, and is snappier thanks to the lack of touchwiz",2016-11-01 22:00:57,"Between the S7E and the Note5, assuming you have used both of them, which one would you recommend to replace my Note7?"
8807,"I'm doing fine with a Note 5. My route was Note 3 &gt; Note 7 &gt; Note 5.

Was lucky to get a 64Mb version, so the lack of SD card is not that bad. Speed is OK. The camera won't replace an DSLR or win any awards but will get you going.

Regarding the battery, some people have very good stories to tell, others have issues. Performance seems to be uneven. I charge every night and haven't had any problems.

The small thing I miss the most is the Always On Display. Tried an app called Glance Plus and didn't like it (plus messed with the battery).",2016-11-01 14:23:56,"Between the S7E and the Note5, assuming you have used both of them, which one would you recommend to replace my Note7?"

8812,"I've had all three. 

Note 5 was my daily driver until the S7 Edge came out. The difference in processor speed (however small or negligible) and the expandable storage were my main two reasons for switching over. I consider myself a power user, always running multiple apps at once, texting and using social media regularly, and the Note 5 seemed a bit sluggish once I got used to the S7 Edge. Then I got the Note 7 and remembered how great the S-Pen is. 

I don't care much for the edge display on the S7 edge, I think it's a gimmick really, but it definitely outperforms the Note 5 in nearly every aspect, especially when you are a power user like me. Note 5 is still a 2015 phone, don't forget. My recommendation is if you think you can survive without the S-Pen until the Note 8 or whatever comes out, go with the S7 Edge.

Unless an IR blaster is somehow a must for you, I couldn't disagree more. One-handed operation isn't as big a deal because the S7 Edge has the same size screen but no bezels, making the phone smaller overall. S7 Edge also has an SD card slot.

Removable battery, seriously? Get a Fast Charge portable that's no much bigger than an internal battery and charge up your S7 Edge or Note 5 in 10 minutes. It's a non-starter. I don't understand why people obsess over removable batteries and give up 100 better features (the camera alone is worth an upgrade) for it. It's irrational.

9208,"Had a chance to use S7 edge for two weeks as a loaner during the first Note 7 recall. Didn't like it. First, the battery life wasn't as great. More annoying was the palm rejection. Note 7's rejection was perfect, no issues ever. S7 edge was annoying as hell. I dind't have a case on either, so that might have amplified the s7 edge palm rejection the issue. Third, the VR experience. Although, the performance on the edge was as smooth as Note 7, it got HOT to touch in 20-30 minutes. I had spent an hour on Note 7 and it only got lightly warm and very decent battery drain. And this is the reason I am not getting the Pixel.

I had bought the phone from a Sprint store at US. Now, Sprint won't help me unless I return them the phone, which I can't of course. Then later Samsung called, apologized for the note 7 issue, sent me an email with instuctions on what to email to Samsung for the refund. They even accepted to refund for any extra cost incurred like hotel cost, missed flights, food, temporary cell-phones etc. It was going smooth and I was constantly getting calls from samsung (because I hadn't submitted those documents). It appeared they were too eager to refund me. Finally, we agreed on the amount which included $100 for the troubles, and around $95 for a temporary phone I had to purchase. And finally I was told I would be getting the cheque within 15 days. All sounded good, and I was feeling quite good about Samsung. However, no cheque yet (and I am at 18 days). Gave a call at 15 days point, to which a lady basically told me: ""I can see that you have reached an agreement on the amount, and everything is set, but I can't see that the cheque has ben sent, and there is no way to confirm this since the people exactly processing this won't take calls. I would suggest you to wait upto Friday, but can't promise anything"". I obediently waited till Friday. Nope. Gave a call today (and this time made sure to record the voice.

But seriously...
- Keep being persistent. 
- Ask to speak to a branch manager. The sales rep have probably been instructed to say what they are saying and don't have the authority to do anything else.
- Document all conversations. Make them aware that you are documenting conversations because of previous experiences in stores and you intend to collate it and use as evidence to support your complaint to Samsung.
- Be ""nice"" about it. Emphasise that it's not their (colleagues) fault, but Samsung have to resolve this issue and is just is not fair on you. They will be more willing to sympathise with you. 
- Don't lose you're cool. They (store colleagues) have every right to say no thanks and goodbye if you lose it with them. Instead stand your ground, be persistent and remain calm. Don't accept a resolution unless it suits you and is reasonable.

I only tried it at one gas station like that, so it might have just been that one that it didn't work on.

One thing I've found a few times though is where it looks like it is going to go through and then just fails for seemingly no reason.  That again could be a problem with the reader (especially since I've seen it happen consistently at the same chain of local grocery stores) but it is still annoying.  These tap to pay systems won't be widely adopted until they are 90%+ foolproof.  But as it stands I only use it if I fairly sure it will work or if there's no line when I'm checking out so it doesn't hold up everyone.",2016-09-19 03:02:07,"Samsung Pay review, as good as it sounds"
9353,"I've had mixed results with magnetic scanners. It seems to be whatever software the store uses rather than an issue with Samsung. The scanners always recognize that data has be sent to them, but it doesn't translate properly on all of them. I did some experimenting on a magnetic credit card reader at work and discovered (besides being insecure--I copied and pasted the asterisks the screen shows and it pasted as all the info I need to buy stuff with other people's money) that the system was receiving all the information needed, it just wasn't putting the numbers and my name in the right fields. There also didn't appear to be an expiration date sent through. Also interesting, the transaction failed even after I manually broke up the information into the right fields but Samsung pay still said it went through and qualified me for the $20 reward. On a failed $.10 purchase that never went through at my bank. I have also had a free tank of gas, where my $30ish transaction went through as $0. It took a day for me to notice, but I was able to make it right with the cashier by using my physical card as a prepayment.

9354,"I've used Samsung Pay three times now. Of those three, it failed the first time (though I put in the wrong PIN at least once, I know I did) and succeeded the other two. In both cases where I used Samsung Pay, it was because I forgot my wallet, and it was a lifesaver in those cases.

Would I rely on it? No, I wouldn't, because I don't see any reason to. I don't mind having a wallet (though I suppose not having one would be nice, too) and I don't trust my phone to work every time.

Now, I do sometimes consider the idea of maybe just trying to use it more often, and frankly most of the examples that you and others have given are in the car. It might be advantageous to just keep a debit card in your center console, for example--if Samsung Pay were reliable, which it may or may not be from my n=3 study.",2016-09-19 09:24:16,"Samsung Pay review, as good as it sounds"

I'd be willing to wager that your happiness going back to an iPhone after your time with Android and specifically the Note series, will be short-lived and you'll miss the feature richness and configurability of Android. The iPhone 7 brings some new niceness, but nothing that stands above the Note 7 in its totality. I'm in no way bashing the Apple eco, again, I own the 6+ and also, an iPad Air 2. That said, those that are deep into the Apple eco will like what the iPhone 7 offers, yet note that to fully enjoy that device, you'll more than likely have to shell out much more $$$$ due to the loss of the headphone jack. I do like the jet black color and will add this; 2017 may bring a more compelling reason to switch back to an iPhone as Apple will finally release a new form factor with its iPhone 8.

&gt; Several Samsung customers suffered property damage after their Note 7s burst into flame, and according to a report from The Guardian, they aren&amp;#039;t happy with how Samsung is treating them.

&gt; A Galaxy Note 7 reportedly exploded in John Barwick&amp;#039;s house in Illinois, unleashing a &amp;quot;Meter long flame&amp;quot; and a noise that Barwick says sounded like &amp;quot;a whole bundle of sparklers being lit all at once.&amp;quot; Barwick told The Guardian that the Note 7 sprayed chemicals &amp;quot;All over our bed, mattress, curtains, and carpet,&amp;quot; and he estimates the damage to be around $9,000.

&gt; Hartzog says a Samsung employee initially promised that the company would pay for a place to stay, but Hartzog told The Guardian, &amp;quot;The next day Samsung Fire &amp; Marine insurance called me and said it wasn&amp;#039;t going to happen. I feel that was really unprofessional.""

9630,"Question.  I dont mind keeping a phone 3 or 4 years.  What are the chances of getting new battery for the note 7 after 2 years done by a professional?  Of course this is just theoretical since this phone is a bust but if it weren't?

edit: my last phone was the Note 2 and of course I changed the batt no problem after 1.5 years.  This Note 7 was supposed to be my next long term phone so I'm curious about how that goes.  Did anyone change their Note 5 battery?

Of course my theory on non-removable batteries is because it makes you change phones every two years.  I'm sure that's part of it anyway.

edit2: I guess most Note 5s may not even be ready for a new battery though.  I guess we are really just getting to around the 1-2 year mark since phones started coming sealed(sans the stinking iphones).",2016-10-12 13:18:25,Strategic Move to Revive The Phablet/Note Series: Bring Back the Removable Battery Form Factor.

&gt; &amp;quot;Because consumers&amp;#039; safety remains our top priority, Samsung will ask all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 while the investigation is taking place,&amp;quot; the company said.

&gt; &amp;quot;Consumers with either an original Galaxy Note 7 or replacement Galaxy Note 7 device should power down and stop using the device and take advantage of the remedies available,&amp;quot; it added.

&gt; They say it&amp;#039;s the cover-up that gets you, and it appears that all the proactive work Samsung did to mitigate the Note 7 fiasco has been undone by being slower to acknowledge that the devices are still dangerous.

Hello everyone, 
 
Thank you all for your patience as we are awaiting news on the Samsung Galaxy Note7 product withdrawal. With everyone being so incredibly excited for this release, I'm sure news of this withdrawal was quite disappointing and disconcerting. We are still awaiting information from Samsung regarding how this will be handled and processed. Keep an eye on our Product Recall page for more information. 
 
For those of you who are within our 14 day Return &amp; Exchange Promise for cell phones, you should feel welcome to return the device if you are not comfortable with keeping it. Currently, we are waiving restocking fees for Note7 returns. Furthermore, please know that you should not be required to return the watch or memory card. However, the waiving of activation fees will ultimately be up to your carrier and may vary from one to another.
 
For those of you that were still awaiting pre-orders and reservations, these are likely to be cancelled as we are no longer going to be fulfilling orders or selling the devices at this time.

We’ll be sure to update this thread as more information becomes available.

Thank you!

9888,"Oh, I love using Best Buy. Since they're trying to stay competitive with Amazon &amp; the likes, they price match &amp; do a lot of other things to make your experience better. I preordered from them for the same day memory card, got my phone on release day with the card, no issues. Turned in my S5 to them &amp; got a $65 gift card, which I then put towards a wireless fast charger (sticker said $60, got it price matched to $40 from Amazon). 

This was my first time using Best Buy for a phone, I'd definitely do it again. Then again, I never had an issue with Verizon (I always went to their corporate stores, that helped). ",2016-09-02 19:46:29,Best Buy Mobile on Note 7 Recall

I spent endless hours trying to get to the right rep and get to the bottom of what happened, but in vain. Apparently this is what AT&amp;T does. 
 
I went in to a BestBuy yesterday (August 19th) to pick up the Note 7 I preordered.
I was the first in line at the store, and everyone else got theirs except me (Sprint, Verizon and Tmobile were all on time). 
So I went in today again, and not only was the Onyx phone not available, they had one in Coral available. 
I was disappointed again to find that AT&amp;T had struck again.
 
Everyone else had these sweet premium Samsung boxes... except for AT&amp;T phones.
Crappy blue and orange flimsy cardboard boxes... this is a disgrace!
Why is AT&amp;T doing this?
Is anyone's contents missing?

And the bloatware!!!
Why is Samsing even allowing this?! 
 
Im definitely canceling my pre-order Samsing. 
Definitely moving to another carrier as well.

That is why you get no compensation if you refund the device and cancel the contract, but you get 30k+70k won if you change the phone to something like an S7 while not breaking your contract.

So if you paid for the whole thing up-front, there really is nothing in it for them if you want to refund the phone.

10030,"Mine is a different situation. Retailer: Carphone Warehouse (CPW), Network: EE... 

I did a pre-order upgrade, received the Note7 and free gear VR 3 days before official launch. It was amazing. I then sold my Note 3.

I went into CPW for the 1st recall and ordered the replacement. I refused to hand in mine though until it arrived. It took about a week to arrive and then I did a data transfer in store to the 2nd Note7. 

Then I heard about the 2nd recall, I was upset. I was um'ing and ar'ing about whether to hand it back.. But I thought there's no point keeping a discontinued phone, so I went into CPW to ask about the process. 

They stated I must hand back the phone, then they will contact my network EE and request that my upgrade is reversed. This was Friday night. They refused to give me a loan phone after handing it back. Samsung refused a loan phone too. Didn't even bother asking EE. 

I waited a few days before going back to the store to upgrade. They say the request to EE wasn't sent until Tuesday (4 days after). I was annoyed. They blamed it on their special department that handles this stuff, which can only be contacted via email. 

I contacted EE and was fobbed off. I contacted CPW customer support and was fobbed off. I went into the store and EE actually spoke to the CPW manager and they both came to the conclusion I simply had to wait for the procedure (CPW telling EE to reverse my upgrade). 

I started getting angry in the CPW store on the phone to a manager at EE and OH! All of a sudden it has magically been processed! I can now upgrade! 

So I chose the Titanium Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Tariff is £12.50 a month cheaper. Got the £100 cashback, they gave me a free Logitech car phone holder worth £50 and a £50 Currys/PCWorld voucher. The S7 Edge upfront cost was £70 though.  

Oh and my refund for the upfront cost of the Note7 was actually £90 instead of the £40 I paid (CPW reduced the cost by £50 when I first upgraded so the receipt says £90). Oh and they accidentally processed the refund twice so I ended up with £180 refunded.

10149,"I'm just not looking forward to the 3200 mAH. My feeling is if the battery is integrated, make it big, which samsung did during the 7 series. Hopefully, the V20 can hit 5 hours SOT with a Bluetooth watch connected (my standard for good battery life on a phone)",2016-10-09 17:32:35,[Discussion] Why I'm switching to a V20 at the end of October
10150,"Screen on the V20 actually has a much higher true resolution than a Pentile OLED on the note 7 though. Pentile matrix OLEDs share a subpixel and hence overall resolution is actually lower than those on full RGB stripe LCD screens. Thats why the 1080p OLED screen on the Oneplus 3 looks so rough and low res.

Plus LCDs dont have burn in issues like you see on Samsung phones displayed at their showrooms.

10347,"TL;DR Sticking with the Note7s until we can get replacement Note7s or more phones really start exploding on the regular.

-----------------

This has been a big debate for my wife and I. We both have Note7s. My wife really hates setting up a new phone so doing three phones in the span of a couple of months is aggravating. I have given her the options with our carrier as well as her previous Note4 that is still setup for her. Granted the Note4 has issues from the Marshmallow upgrade and needs a hard reset to be functional again. Right now she's inclined to stick with it unless I feel there's an immediate danger. I may just make her charge it in the dutch oven like someone here mentioned.

Myself, I'm torn as well. I didn't find out until this past weekend that 17 of those original 35 reports were here in the US. If more start exploding, I may reluctantly take it back. I'm going to want a full refund for these shenanigans. An S7 just isn't going to cut it; we both use the stylus quite a bit and enjoy the size. I may consider a V20, but I don't know what she will do. Maybe I can convince her to go back to the Note4 if things get sparky.",2016-09-12 20:28:55,[Discussion] Is anybody still using their Note 7?

A supervisor also notated my account saying that the store WILL and SHOULD return it. I go to the sprint corporate store and they turn me down saying they won't return it. Mind you I didn't put money down on the phone, I just payed for the avtivation fee, so regardless the sprint store wouldn't be hurting if I returned it. I called back and spoke to someone higher. He called the store and 1 hour and 28 minutes later, he took me off hold and told me they were arguing back and forth because the store refused to return my device. Period. So all and all, he is calling the district manager tomorrow, and I'm assuming at that point I'll be able to return it. I don't need a loaner device cause I have a back up nexus 6p and an iPhone 6 Plus. I simply just wanted to return my device.

10476,"Naked, as with all my previous phones. 
I will buy a case for special occasions, like when using the phone as a GPS during hikes, but otherwise I really despise all the ugly contraptions people put their phones into. 

I get it that they don't want to scratch it, but why would it even matter if they scratched it, if they never see the phone in its own glory.   

In my opinion this phone is great:

* **because of its small size relative to the screen size:** this would be cancelled out by a big ugly case 
* **because of the curved edges:** these are hidden or ruined by most cases and protectors
* **because of the perfect writing experience:** which is reduced by screen protectors
* **because of the exceptional touch screen responsiveness:** which is why it's possible to operate them even behind a screen protector, but you loose some of the effect
* **because of the beautiful design:** replace it with a $15 ugly plastic ""bag"" or ""box"" made by a random unknown Chinese company?

If you regularly use a case, you take away all these pluses.

**Put it in a case to reserve it for the next owner???** Makes no sense to me.

I did buy a 1 year **insurance** plan, so if I do drop it (I haven't dropped a phone in a few years) I wouldn't need to pay the whole $1100 again (price in my country, more than my monthly salary). As and added bonus this also covers theft and water damage in case the water protection is not as robust as they say (warranty does not cover water damage!!)

Been reading about the glass. Was hoping GG5 would be a step closer to the ultimate goal of sapphire glass (this still a thing in the future?), but alas, it appears softer.

This is a problem for me as I keep the phone in my pockets with other items... some of which can have potential to scratch.

Anyone seen these cases from Samsung in person, or have any feedback? I know case is sub-optimal, but at $850 I'm not going to risk a scratched screen that will drive my OCD self nuts.

Just finished chatting with AT&amp;T who said the phones will be shipped via FedEx, and I should receive them tomorrow or Thursday--Saturday being the latest. I asked if they were being shipped 2 day or overnight and she says it depends on what option the agent selected in store. (I'm hoping he had a shred of decency and selected overnight.)

I also like the part where you brought up the investment bit. People think I'm crazy when I say I'd pay outright $800 for a phone. We always have them on us,  and for what they can do I'd say it's more than worth the price. 

I would have kept mine, but just the annoyance of flying with it,  living in dorms (imagine the paperwork if anything were to happen) and that I was able to get a free TV out of it,  I figured I could wait till next year when one comes out that may be safe.

And in the small tiny chance if it does go off, losing a lot of credibility would be getting off lucky.  You can lose a lot more.

10663,"It's your choice even if it potentially puts you and those around you at risk. I wouldn't keep it but then again I also do not do the TSA cancer causing screening. 

It's a bit unfair to compare the two though, Samsung isn't a government entity. They can act freely and address the issue while TSA will need a new president to make things great again by shutting them down. Samsung isn't imposed but the TSA cancer booths were - and that's not the fault of the American people. That's the fault of those in power right now.

Since I'm also the one that stated that you can't compare this to car accidents I'll go ahead and restate that car accidents, unlike the note 7,are almost always caused by driver error - drunk, speeding, distracted, what have you - and if they wouldn't have done those things the accident would have been avoided. A randomly exploding electronic device without any known trigger is as dangerous as you can get. Again, no comparison between the two.

These software updates could come in the Nougat update to S7. Sometimes Samsung doesn't take features from newer devices to older models, but I think in this case the product cannibalism is not an issue anymore. So they might bring improved always on display, secure folder, camera software etc. to the S7

* S Pen is a big plus: handwriting, note taking, precise pointer, usability in heavy rain, wearing gloves, long nails etc.
* Note 7 has iris scanner: unlock phone when wearing gloves
* **S7 edge has more accidental touch issues on the edges**
* S7 edge has half the internal memory (many things only work in the internal, including some photo modes)
* Note 7 has dual light sensor: **best auto brightness of any phone**
* Note 7 has variable brightness L.E.D. lights (bright enough during the day, not blinding at night)
* Note 7 has the brightest screen of any phone
* Note 7 does HDR video playback at hardware level, all video, VR all benefitted from this
* **Note 7 newer, better software (notifications in always on screen, blue light filter, special game modes)**
* **Note 7 has improved camera software**
* **Note 7 has improved secure folder, install 2nd copy of apps**
* Note 7 is more comfortable to hold in hand
* Note 7 is more shatter resistant (and as we learned as scratch resistant as the S7Edge)

I've gone to stores and they've told me they have no idea when they'll get more in stock and to just put my name down for a waiting list.  I've tried calling T-Mobile (through 611) multiple times and they've told me they can only try to call stores for me near me (which they did and failed to find one) and told me to just go to one and put my name down for a waitlist.  When I told them why are some people able to call in and get one specially delivered to them overnight to a store they only responded with ""We did do that but just for two days when we first got new Note 7s, since then we've been instructed we can't do that anymore.""  I'm getting so annoyed and I really think that stores are SELLING them before giving them to recalled customers to make some money.

If it's been delivered then they can do it they just need to get it out of thejr delivery box and then do the exchange and put it in '2nd and faulty'. Don't let them say they can't do anything when we can.

&gt; While Samsung investigates multiple reports of issues, T-Mobile is temporarily suspending all sales of the new Note7 and exchanges for replacement Note7 devices.

&gt; Customers can still bring their recalled Note7 or the new replacement Note7, along with accessories they purchased from T-Mobile, to a T-Mobile store for a full refund and choose from any device in T-Mobile&amp;#039;s inventory.

&gt; To help offset any additional costs our customers may have incurred throughout this process, anyone who returns their recalled Note7 will automatically receive a one-time $25 credit on their T-Mobile bill within two bill cycles.

&gt; To help offset any additional costs our customers may have incurred throughout this process, anyone who returns their recalled Note7 will automatically receive a one-time $25 credit on their T-Mobile bill within two bill cycles.

11165,"Hey mate. I've been running the 6p alongside the note 7. Dunno if this gonna help but here are a few things that in my short time separate the two: 

**Points for the Note 7**

- Ease of handling. The phone is genuinely easier to use in terms of physical size. Plus the triple press for one-handed use is great (dunno if you can do this on the 6p)

- The ability to preview links is quite handy, not to mention having your social/productivity apps up and running in bubble form so you can drop in and rop out ultra fast 
- This may be just my 6P but the battery on the Note 7 seems to power through quite a bit longer than my 6P. this may completely be due to me having to replace the nexus screen with an aftermarket one
- most obviously is the S-pen functionality for document work and sharing functionality. the Nexus can indeed do most of this but the ease of use makes me pick up the note much more 
- I find the notifications for the Note to be a tad bit better. Mostly because I can double tap the notification and use my iris to jump right into it, without needed to use the fingerprint scanner. 

- Fingerprint scanner placement. This is highly subjective, and honestly i think the Nexus fingerprint scanner is more useful as it wakes up the phone too, but if you have your phone on the desk or flat surface than the Note's scanner is more convenient. 

**Points for the Nexus 6P**

- Media consumption. Although the screen of the Note 7 is Krispy Kreme, the stereo speakers just make it better for me. 

- OS butteriness. This is a point that's been beaten to death, but it has to be mentioned. It's really personal, but I think the features of touchwiz balances out the stability of stock android

- google integration. I am an avid google apps user, and only recently am giving samsung apps a go. I like how the dialer can ID numbers and the UI of Google calander. I believe Samsung has it's own version of number ID but I don't think it is as good as Google's.

- Google's voice assistant is miles ahead of S-voice. But this is only a minor point if you're fine with going that extra step to open up the google now app, or if you use the ""OK google"" voice command on the regular. 

- Update frequency. This is obviously in favour of Google's flagship. But it's once again (like all points) very subjective. If you're okay with an older version of android but with more functionality and features, then this won't be an issue, unless phone security is a major priority for you. 

**Final points**

Sorry if the points are obvious or not helpful, I only have had the Note 7 for a few days, but I will be continuing to test the two phones side-by-side for the next 30 days as the return policy here in Australia is pretty nice. Please feel free to message me for anything else you would like to know. I am in the same boat as you as the Nexus is still a powerhouse and punches well above its weight. but from initial use, the Note 7's features and ease of multimedia sharing and capturing draw me to use it more.

**TL;DR** I'd go for the Nexus if the S-pen is rarely used and/or Touchwiz is a hinderance. Pick the Note 7 if the feature set that comes from the stylus and Touchwiz making your phone use and experience more  convenient and applicable to your daily phone use.

I really only upgraded from the Note 5 since I dropped it from my hamper onto my glass weight scale(2 whole feet) and it smashed the metal around the volume up button so that the button would stick when pressed unless I pressed it from the lower angle.

11325,Don't get a Note if you want to install custom roms.,2016-08-13 12:42:35,Switching from Nexus 4 this year. Leaning towards a Note 7 but have a few questions. Help me make my decision!
11326,"The Note will be bootloader locked across all carriers and don't plan on that changing. You'll also lose Samsung pay if and when a root exploit is discovered. 

Download Package Disabler Pro and you can disable and hide any and every app you don't deem necessary all from one interface. 

Samsung theme store or Samsung's Good Lock app let you get pretty close to that stock look. Material Dark theme as an example. 

Nova Prime launcher also lets you get pretty close to the stock launcher with customizable gestures and etc. 

Custom Roms on Samsung phones never seem to work out right.. you always sacrifice something like camera performance, loss of S Pen software, and etc. To me it's not worth it just to gain better battery life with a new kernel and/or overclocked CPU.

11327,"Yeah, I'm referring to the bootloader. I plan to go into a store to see if a rep knows the answer. I imagine since the S7E was locked, the Note 7 will be, which is hugely disappointing. I really just want root for xposed. I don't need any custom roms or anything, just want the extra functionality. In the meantime, disabling will do.

11328,"I've been doing a lot of research. I'm debating whether I should wait to see the Nexus's specs. The thing is, the Note 7 looks so good that I doubt the Nexus will really be as good, and definitely won't be better. Now my debate centers around getting the Snapdragon version vs. the Exynos version, since the latter is more likely to be unlocked. I don't need custom roms, but I do want to root to have xposed.",2016-08-13 11:38:30,Switching from Nexus 4 this year. Leaning towards a Note 7 but have a few questions. Help me make my decision!
11329,"Yeah, that's what I'm leaning towards. I'll end up kicking myself though if I still go with a Note 7 after waiting to see the Nexus specs and pass up the free goody I could get with the Note 7.

As for rooting, at this point, all I really want is xposed. I'm content without a custom ROM. Xposed does enough for me as is. Hopefully the Note 7 will get root eventually. If I get the new Nexus I'll be waiting for xposed a bit anyway.",2016-08-13 11:25:18,Switching from Nexus 4 this year. Leaning towards a Note 7 but have a few questions. Help me make my decision!

11331,"You wont regret it, ive also had the iphone since 3gs days and have been switch back and forth. I hated android for a while since it wasnt stable since I had my s3 and most things i wanted to do - like apps arent there yet for android ""hbo go"" etc. 

but these days you wont notice a difference. I dont game on my phone so im more of browsing and social media - camera so it is a better experience for me being on android right now. Material design is so pleasing and refreshing having been with iOS for a while. Themes are also great on android too, i didnt have to root or dive into the phone to try to customize it. I know its a little thing to be excited about but its great being able to change the fonts on your phone.

I loved how I could see people typing and if my message was delivered and read for some people who had that turned on.  FaceTime was great too.   Now Samsung has FaceTime as well.   Recently I've started to realize the real limitations of an iPhone. I play Pokemon go and Simeon created a screen overlay for Pokemon go that you can't use on iPhone. I really wanted to use it but j couldn't.  Sometimes when I'm driving or doing some chores around the apartment, I put on a YouTube play list.  If I get a Facebook messenger message. It closes out YouTube and stops my music. Android does not do that. I finally made the decision to preorder be note 7 and I'm so excited. ",2016-08-11 11:43:24,Switching from iPhone 6 Plus to Note7.

I took some notes a week or two ago.

In the 2-3 months:

- 6 different phones (Note 4 -&gt; Note 7 V1 -&gt; S7 loaner -&gt; Note 7 V2 -&gt; iPhone 5S temporary -&gt; Pixel XL)

- 4 full backups and restores

- 2 refunds requested and processed with Amazon

- Just over two hours spent on three separate calls to VZW

- 4 chats with VZW support

- 3hr total spent in VZW stores

- Jokes at my expense from friends, family, coworkers and people I didn't even know that recognized the phone.

- Samsung Gear VR that just taunted me for weeks (Note 7 was blacklisted one day before I got it from Samsung), which I finally just gave away to a friend.

- Disappointment from my iPhone-loving wife as our VZW billing and credit card statements got all jacked up.

Well, from a technical standpoint, the reason the theme could improve device performance is due to the AMOLED screen. More pure black colors within the theme objectively means less pixels tasked with constant operation. This theoretically could improve battery life and reduce some processing.

Do I think the gains are significant?  No, they probably aren't but we won't know unless we run a comparison with a control group using the default theme.

The FAA will drag it's heels in order not to cause longer delays at check points and the airline  service go to hell. Then all the airlines will have to reschedule close connectecting flights costing them time and more importantly...money.

Until it becomes official or a more reoccurring incident...its probably still on the round table being discussed with minimal urgency.

Waiting game for now. And besides, they have to decide if it's something the flight crew can handle with a extinguisher. Most phones are in people's hands and secondly in their bag in the overhead compartment. Someone will notice as soon as it happens. It won't be like the guys car or someone's garage who wasn't home and it had an hour or two to burn everything to the ground.

Now on the other hand...how big is this battery explosion? Little fire cracker pop and some flames? Or is it a small amount of black powder going off that can bust a hole into a aluminum wall and depressurize the cabin? Obviously not that lethal with 35 confirmed incidents and information on it....yet.

11763,"Technically there is no ""explosion"" as per almost every media outlet is saying..  What happens is what they call a ""Thermal Runaway"" with Lithium-Ion batteries.  

Worst case you'll hear a ""popping"" sound almost like popcorn in a microwave.  Most however would not even do this and instead just fizzle and start to burn.  If you pay attention to any of the pictures out there, none of them have ""exploded"" and are still in-tact and are instead charred and burnt.

If you are going by Celsius temperatures then the battery will be fine all the way up to 60C.  If it starts reaching higher than 60C I would at that point try and shut it down in hopes it won't have a thermal runaway.  Essentially if your battery reaches 90C to 100C range this is when a thermal runaway will occur with the Lithium-Ion batteries inside the Note 7 and this is also when you'll possibly see some flames and darkening of your screen as it begins to burn from the inside and break through the foil packaging of the cell.",2016-09-08 00:20:04,"[discussion]Explosion process, Does the phone explode without any warning.

11800,"PROS:


- open to customization, you'll enjoy making it feels like its your unique phone. ( you can apply new launchers, lock screen, icon packs, keyboard, themes, widgets ...etc)

- Easy to download music and movies and documents as easy as a computer ( no need to 3rd party apps downloaders, no more itunes ) 

- You have access to your internal folders and files as if your phone is a huge USB 

- Always On Display 

- best multitasking experience (opening 2 apps at once as a spilt screen mode , swipe to minimize apps, glance feature )

- Fast charging and wireless charging.

- Amazing display ( qhd resolution combined with AMOLED is much better than iphone's retina LCD IPS )

- its design combines beauty and functionality ( stunning design of metal and glass + edge + feels so comfy in the hand) 

- bigger screen than the iphone 6s PLUS with a slightly smaller body! 

- virtual reality ( you can get yourself additional gadgets like gear VR + gear 360 )

- Much better camera in all different situations + wider angle selfie camera in addition to manual aka PRO mode

-  IP68 water and dust resistance

- You have that ""default apps"" thingie that let's you choose a certain app to run certain type of files ( like a 3rd party app to run videos, adobe reader for pdfs instead of stock pdf reader, a 3rd party music player instead of stock player, when you click a link you can set chrome as default instead of stock browser.. and much more examples) 

- Iris scanner + secure folder that let's have a dedicated 2nd copy of apps ( like fb whatsapp and ig in addition to gallery and camera and lots and lots more)

- You can set both fingerprint scanner and iris scanner to use at once, for example, when your hands are wet you can swipe to use iris scanner, otherwise you can simply use your fingerprint for faster and easier unlocking. so iris scanner is no longer considered as a "" gimmick""  for me.

- S Pen has got way too many ways to benefit of having it ! ( no need to mention any because they're obvious) 

- Samsung Notes is the best note taking app ever, hands down.


CONS: 

- you'll miss everything related to apple ecosystem ( imassages, facetime, itunes, icloud.. etc ) but of course, google provides tons of alternatives, and apple music is already available for android.

- you won't seem cool between your friends anymore ;D 

- iphone is slightly faster and smoother.

- snapchat is much more optimized for ios than android ( it's snapchat developers' fault not android's fault )

- iphones tend to be more durable and reliable, but it's not a big deal for me since i will upgrade every 1 or 2 years.

- the glass of the note7 makes it slippery, fingerprint magnet and more fragile compared to aluminum , yet it looks much more attractive, so a case/screen protector is a must!

- You might notice some sorts of battery drain in standby mode (while screen is off) it's an Android thing, deal with it, however you have to DISABLE BLOATWARE ASAP it causes the drain to be aggressive ( usually losing 3%~7% while asleep in the night is average, just turn off wifi and cellular data)

- Speakers are a letdown, not as loud and as crisp as iphones.

&gt; You know what i like about Apple, uniformity (not to be confused with conformity). In a world of android phones made by different brands trying to topple each other, ""This one has NFC"", ""This one has a psuedo-3d screen"", ""This one is slightly different from the other because the edge of it is its own screen"". Where i might buy a Samsung Note one day but oh look 3 months later the new Sony is out with ""better specs"" and then 2 months after that ASUS has something new.


&gt; Yes apple fans get a lil crazy and yes many pay for the brand alone, but unlike android they just dont throw new technology into a phone and try to rush to call it the ""first"". Yes NFC has been out, but who other than gas stations and some grocery stores were using it before apple went out and solicited more vendors. Yes touch-id was in the last one, but its a great leap in use with ios 8 and the conjunction with nfc. Someone yesterday tried to tell me that it was only a shitty 8mp camera, not understanding that throwing a bigger number in front of it doesn't make it a clearer picture. I would rather buy a new number on an iphone every 2 years than try to rifle through the ridiculous amounts of new android phones that come out almost on a monthly basis.


My head was ALL the way up my ass with that logic.  And now i'm sitting here loving my note 7, wondering how I was able to think like that.  Even iPhone's sand-boxed applications are annoying to think about these days.  The things i used to jailbreak for on iphone are standard on android.

iOS and the iPhone 6 Plus still feels like a smoother experience where everything 'just works'.  Android and the Note 7 feels like freedom, but that freedom comes at the cost of the occasional hiccup or stutter.

I think the biggest issue with the switch is your app purchases.  If you're heavily invested in Apple's apps, then switching to Android and Google apps can be a bit of a struggle and potentially costly.  There are some apps for iOS that simply don't exist for Android or are worse than they were on iOS.  The reverse is true as well.

Any apps you purchased will have to be re-purchased on Google Play and many games/apps with saved data will be wiped when you go to the Android side.  Some games, like Clash of Clans, work on both sides and you will lose no data.  Other games, like Castle Clash, have separate iOS and Android servers and if you switch, you'll lose access to your old game data and will have to start over.

That being said, after the initial migration, you'll find there isn't anything you could do on iOS that you can't do on Android, you just had to learn the Android way of getting it done.",2016-08-30 09:43:41,Switch from iPhone?

11827,"I don't know why Target wouldn't have a phone set aside for you if you pre-ordered one, but buying the phone at full retail price does not mean that you can just buy a phone in a box and walk out with it.

It needs to be associated with your account, somehow.

11829,"The person who sold you the phone is actually correct. Please let me explain why and also how to get around it. When a new phone is launched, the makers of the phone (Samsung, Apple, etc.) specifically tell Target Mobile that they are not allowed to sell any of them outright for a specific period of time. Currently, if someone came in to buy the new iPhone 7 outright, we cannot do it. Target's contract with either Apple or the phone company states all phones must be sold with a plan for the first few weeks. Last year, the iPhone 6s was launched in late September and it wasn't until early December that we were able to sell them outright. Same deal with Samsung as well. Phone came out in late February and we were not allowed to sell them outright until April. 

Now, what you can do, let's say the cost of the phone is $792 (cost of the Galaxy s7 Edge). Verizon will give you the option to put down as much as you want towards the phone at the time of purchase, but you must leave $24 ($1 a month for 24 months). After 30 days (for Verizon and Sprint, 2 billing cycles for AT&amp;T) you can call into the company and pay off the remaining balance. 

No one is trying to ""screw you"" here, I assure you. We have a district manager and a ""News You Can Use"" that is released 3-4 times a week that makes the selling outright of devices very clear. If I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to respond here or an inbox.

A discharge and charge session from 100% to 80% to 100% (or a 20% charge session would have to happen 5 times before it would equal 1 full charge cycle. Also research shows that keeping lithium based batteries in between 50-90% charged all the time is better than letting them discharge completely. See this link: http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries

Note that a lithium based battery could only handle a Full discharge cycle from (100% to 0% to 100%) 300-500 times before only retaining 70% of original capacity, but the same battery can handle 3,000-5,000 cycles from shallower discharges (100%-75%-100%)

One of the best things about Android is being able to customize the UX to your liking. There's a theme in the Samsung theme store called Material Dark and I recommend you try it. Also download Nova launcher and learn how to use gestures to do stuff and etc. Maybe grab a custom icon pack and try some of those out. Tapet is a pretty cool wallpaper app that randomly changes your wallpaper based on ones you like in their algorithm. SwifKey is another must have if you want better predictions and a fixed number row in your keyboard. Get on the XDA page for the Note 7 and ask questions there...

Of course it's with iPhones so a bit different but gives you an idea what goes above and beyond the standard drop. 

The newish thing seems to be air pocket protection on the corners. For example the spigen crystal shell. Not sure if it works but seems like a solid concept. 

As far as brands I don't care too much for otter box just because they are so bulky. I like spigen, UAG, Speck, and Caseology and a couple others I can't think of.

As for a screen protector, the second glass type (the ones that break before the glass of the phone does, supposedly) never last long with me. They crack within the first week usually.

12092,"This should be interesting.

Edit:
From Forbes dot com.......""Approximately 70% of Stamford, Connecticut-based Harman’s $7 billion in revenue is in the automotive sector.  Regardless of what brand of vehicle you own, there is a pretty good chance that there is some Harman-made equipment and software on board. Harman is probably best known to consumers for its core Harman Kardon brand. However, much of Harman’s growth in the past couple of decades has come from the acquisition of other audio brands including JBL, Revel, Infinity, Becker, AKG, B&amp;O Play and others.

Most automakers now offer branded premium audio systems as an extra cost option to help distinguish themselves from the competition. It turns out though that just as Luxotica owns most of the better known brands of eyeglasses, many of these audio systems come from from Harman.""

But the two kickers for me are the snappiness, this thing is fast, and the DAC. Holy shit, the phone sounds amazing!",2016-11-05 15:52:56,Any Ex-Note 7 Owners Who have the LGV20?
12094,"After the first recall I used the S7 edge and just really disliked it. The curve was too much and I was always activating it without meaning to, even with a case. At T-Mobile the only colors they had were silver and Rose Gold and I hated both of those colors. 

This time I went with the V20, mainly because I had the V10 before the N7 and had experienced what life was like with a DAC. The N7 was Just good enough to put up with no DAC, but the S7E fell below that line for me. Seriously, I just have a $40 pair of superlux headphones and they sound AMAZING on the V20. I can listen to music pretty much my entire shift at work so I put a pretty high importance on this. 

Its a little harder to hold in the hand than the N7, but for me it is still better than holding the S7E cause I dont have to worry about activating the edge when reaching across. 

I actually love the screen. here is the thing though, when I turned in my N7 the V20 wasnt released yet, so I got an Iphone 7 to use as a loaner (I never had an Iphone before, thought I would try it) and going from the tiny, low(er) resolution Iphone to the V20 just blew my mind. helped ease me out of SAMOLED I guess.

The camera takes great pictures, to me they seem about the same as the Note 7 using quick settings, but the camera app seems to be a bit laggier to operate and launch than the N7. All the reviews say that this camera Focuses super fast but I havent noticed that to be the case on mine. 

Other than the camera app, the rest of the phone runs noticibly smoother than the N7. Very happy with the performance. 

I may be a little Biased dince I had and liked the V10, but I am absolutely sure this phone is a much better choice for me thatn the S7E",2016-11-06 00:42:35,Any Ex-Note 7 Owners Who have the LGV20?

For me it was between the v20 and the Pixel to replace my note 7 with. The Pixel didn't come to my carrier and it was a little too much like an iPhone for my liking, the second screen is by far more useful than the edge thing on the S7E and the note 7 ever was. And even with the size of the phone it still feels great in your hand.

12106,"Got mine this past Thursday, and at first I was a little apprehensive but honestly it's grown on me.  Here's some thoughts on the difference between the two. 

1. Obviously, AMOLED vs LCD was quite a big change. I miss the vibrant colors of the note 7. I have it on auto brightness and I changed the comfort view to low, so it's a bit warmer colors now. 

2. The screen: the screen is pretty good looking. The second screen is also a nice touch but it's so high up that it's hard to use. I do have a few short cuts on there that I use quite often but I wish it was more reachable. The only thing that bugs me about the second screen is the bleed through from the second screen to the main screen when I'm in a dark room it's very noticeable nd very annoying.  

3. Battery: I've only had it for 2 days but so far the battery is pretty decent. I'll have to test it better. It's removable so I can always buy a spare like I did with my note 3. 

4. The ui: ever since I switched to Android in 2013 I've only had Samsung and as soon as I got it I would put nova on it.  I did the same as soon as I got my v20, but things like the dialer and contacts show how ugly the ui really is. It's just very huge buttons and just ugly but thsg a just my opinion. 

5. Other: the fingerprint sensor being in the back is something I needed to adjust to as well. I keep reaching for the bottom of the screen  to unlock it. Double tap to unlock is a pretty great alternative.  


Overall I like the phone more than I thought I would. I do miss my note 7,but not as bad I thought I would. The v20 definitely feels snappier. The volume is a bit louder than the note 7 but at full volume it tends to crack. I think this phone will definitely hold me over until the note 8 (or whatever it's going to be called).

If you fall in love with a phone, after the 18 months you can just pay off the remaining balance over 6 months and keep the phone. Its just creative financing.

If Note7 breaks Samsung has got your back.

If V20 breaks LG will maybe repair it, and it may even be faster than two months and there's even a small chance your phone won't turn into a beat-up and scratched piece of shit. ",2016-10-07 16:16:59,Note 7 over V20?
12227,"NB: I had a G3 and G4 prior to the N7. In a way I somewhat resented the removable battery on my G4 because, by the time I got rid of it, it was going through a charge so fast.   
The N7 is so much better in battery life for me (that the G4), I can't even describe it. 

I unlearned the double tap to wake pretty quickly, especially since the power button is on the side. The back button always seemed a bit gimmicky, and was just as likely to get pressed in my pocket. Also, the notifications on the AOD on the N7 are double-tap to wake (double tap the mail icon to wake and bring up the mail app, for example).

I had wireless charging backs for my G3, but the G4 back was a little dodgy so I swapped it back for the original.  Now that I have wireless charging back with the N7 I realize how nice it was not to have to plug in.  
As for heat - the N7 gets nowhere near as hot as my G4 did, esp that back button. It will get warm if I'm using it heavily, but it's about the same as my daughter's iPhone 6s plus.   

I kind of wish I had a superwide angle camera, but the 26mm eq on the Note 7 is pretty wide. I'm super happy with the results of the camera, though.  I mean: Nightclub http://imgur.com/a/5ZP74 and day/night http://imgur.com/a/TS7or shots are all good. ",2016-10-07 15:27:03,Note 7 over V20?

12298,"I switched from the 6P to a Exynos Note 7. I'm unbelievably happy with the upgrade, it's my favourite phone since my iPhone 4 - performance is excellent, and with good lock, etc, I can get it looking like stock in most cases.",2016-10-01 18:52:27,Switching from Nexus 6P to Note 7?
12299,"&gt;The things I care the most about in a phone are:

 * Smooth, buttery performance

**With some tweaks to bloatware, performance of the N7 is top notch**

* An amazing display and an amazing camera

**IMO this phone certainly has both, Camera takes great pictures at night or low light. Display looks sweet going edge to edge, left to right. At the right angle, it looks like the phone has no bezel at all.**

* I use ""OK Google"" fairly often when the screen is off (from what I understand this is an issue on Note 7?)

**Depends on how your lock and security settings are set up, or if your work uses an MDM solution that has specific administrative privs.**

* Navigation when in the car (though I don't use this that often)

**I work in my car. Google maps has improved a ton and does not poll the GPS as often. This slows down corrections to your path if you make a wrong turn, just slightly, but other than that, navigation is fine. You might like Car Mode (comes with the phone) and has some cool car features including easy navigation.**

&gt; So I'd like to ask:

* Is there anyone here on this sub who switched from Nexus 6P? What was your experience like?

**I did not, but I have a coworker on my business account that has one, is is seriously considering the N7. He no longer cares about having early releases of ROMs, nor does he care any longer about Google and Android. He is looking for more about functionality.**

* Can I already purchase the Gear VR for Note 7?

**Yes http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/gear-vr/**

* What's the best place for me to buy an unlocked Note 7?

**Amazon, or samsung.com, probably**

12301,"you can stop considering the Note 7 if ""Smooth, buttery performance"" is listed at the top of what you want. Samsung fanboys gonna get mad at me, but I've used multiple Note 7s now and i also have bunch of other phones on me, and it is a fact that the Note 7 is laggier/slower than just about any other 2016 flagship. OnePlus 3 way smoother. iPhone 7 Plus and LG G5 also smoother. everytime i go into settings on the Note 7 and search, there's like a one to second delay before anything loads. when i hit ""share"" from a Chrome webpage, there's a slight hiccup before the share menu is fully loaded. all these things are instantaneous on the OnePlus 3 or Huawei P9. 

now the Note 7 isn't slow to the point that it's problematic, but it's just not the smoothest/fastest phone out there by a long shot. 

the people who say my Note 7 has ""no lag"" or ""performance is top notch"", they're likely comparing to their previous Samsung phone. TouchWiz lag is noticeable to anyone who jumps around from phone to phone. 

ALSO, this isn't to say i don't like my Note 7. i still marvel at how Samsung managed to fit a 5.7-inch screen into a body that's smaller than all other 5.5-inch phones out there. and the camera is great, arguably the best. i'm merely saying that in terms of SMOOTH/FAST software, this phone is not the best, not at all.

12302,"I switched from Nexus 6P to the Note 7

/u/​herbertJblunt and since use already answered your questions. Just additional stuff and my opinion;

- the Note screen is much better and brighter
- the auto brightness of the Note 7 is amazing and works perfectly, Nexus 6P wasn't good at all
- I'm not a fan on on-screen-buttons, which you have on the Nexus, the Note is much better to handle
- form factor is much better, you can also use the Note 7 with one hand, with my Nexus it wasn't possible
- the Nexus soaked were better, but I seldomly use the, so it's not a big loss
- The Note has tons of features which are amazing, which I can't live without anymore (S pen text input, possibility to select any text with the S pen, smart select, GIF creation possibility,  swipe to wake in front of device, edge features like edge apps, edge tasks, edge Tasker tasks etc.  )
- rooting with Nexus 6P is easy and fast done, and also can be reverted easily, but with Note 7 it's difficult and it will trip Knox, so you will lose your warranty 
- Nexus phones gets the Android updated and also versions before anyone else, so you can jump to Nougat, while you have to stick for month to marshmallow until you'll get your update from Samsung
- almost all stock apps from Samsung are great, even in comparison with stock Google apps and the best apps available, they're smooth, offer much, are good integrated, themes work on them and lot more reasons
- lot more stuff but I think you get the main stuff and ideas",2016-10-01 19:51:59,Switching from Nexus 6P to Note 7?

12406,"I had a similar experience with Sprint, but fortunately, I was dealt with a good customer rep at the 34th St Sprint Store in NYC (a person named Nash. Thank you Nash!) that was able to break the seemingly endless cycle of he said-she said.

My issue was, I had a 2-year contract for my Note 7 so stores told me they couldn't do the replacement exchange at their store and that I needed to do it from the way I originally bought it- online. When I call Sprint Customer Care, they would tell me that the stores should be able to do it regardless of my contract type. 3 stores later, Nash told me the same thing. However, she also went the extra mile to confirm with her supervisor and also look further into my account. After asking confirmation from me that my phone was on a business account, and I said yes, she was able to proceed with the exchange. Man, what a life saver. Because I saw 2 customers earlier leave the store without a phone (after waiting 2 hours!) because they were also on a 2 year non-installment plan.

The whole ordeal was a nightmare. I went to the store on 42nd St by Bryant Park, a store in the Bronx an hour away at White Plans Rd and Story Ave. Then finally to this 34th st Store by Herald Square. I was on the phone with Sprint for over 3 hours total because of this crap.

I was told the phones from Customer Care are backordered for 2-3 weeks due to issues supplying fire-proof return kits provided by Samsung for you to send your old Note 7 back to them. That's why Customer Care was so adamant in suggesting I have my phone exchanged in store even though I already had a phone replacement order in place since 9/12/16.

I'm just glad this crap is over for me. Thanks again to Nashley Chavez at the 34th St Sprint Store. You're a lifesaver.",2016-09-23 17:07:37,"[Discussion] My Terrible Ordeal With The Note 7 Recall (Sprint) - very, very long read"

It's rare that I would drop my phone, but all-metal phones don't provide much grip, so a skin is perfect. With the Note7's glass back, the fingerprints are annoying, so again the skin is a great solution.

12647,"Surprisingly I found Opera to be the fastest. Didn't figure out how to sync it with the desktop browsers (I use safari and chrome) yet. It's based on Chrome so it renders sites correctly, but apparently is optimized better and is faster ",2016-08-21 19:56:05,Samsung Internet or Chrome?
12648,"I used to use Chrome almost exclusively, but I've recently switched to Samsung Internet and honestly couldn't be happier. 
It's not perfect, and there are things I think it needs improvement on, but there's enough good here to make me favor it over Chrome. 

The good (main reasons over Chrome)
1. Performance - In my personal testing, Samsung Internet is way faster and more lag free than Chrome. This could be simply because it's a much lighter browser that was designed solely for mobile use. (Most other browsers have desktop counterparts and their code-bases are somewhat shared)
2. Biometrics in the Browser - you can log in with your fingerprint to websites. I've been using dashlane for a while now but it can be really iffy in its responsiveness. Samsung Internet does this much faster, smoother, and without hiccups. 
3. Secret Mode - kind of like privacy mode or incognito mode in chrome, whereby it will allow you to browse sites anonymously, and the sites you visit do not save in your history, etc. The main difference is that it's persistent and locked by biometrics (fingerprint or iris scanning). This means you can have 3 or more sites open in Secret, switch over to normal tabs, then open up secret again and fund those sites still there. Pretty cool and useful stuff
4. Extensions (most importantly, AdBlocking) - Samsung Internet supports extensions that let you add functionality to the browser. The current most useful available is AdBlocking (there are a few options but I use AdBlock Plus, with some settings tweaked because by default it allows ""nonintrusive ads"")

The not so good
1. While your bookmarks can be saved and synced (works better now that we have the samsung cloud), it's not the seamless ""always instantly in the cloud"" way that chrome does things. Can be iffy for some people
2. Biometrics do not save through devices, so if you save passwords and logins and you factory reset or have multiple phones, you'll have to save all of those again. 
3. Available extensions is pretty lacking right now, but the feature just came out so hopefully it'll grow with time.

I haven't tried the chrome extension that allows you to sync with Samsung Internet, but if it works that solves point #1. 

I'm rather enjoying Samsung Internet. Chrome is chrome so it's the same experience of the desktop on mobile, but kinda laggy and heavy (for a mobile browser)
