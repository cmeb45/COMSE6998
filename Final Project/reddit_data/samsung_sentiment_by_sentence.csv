3925,1836,1,The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen has the iris scanner as a security option and of course the greatly improved S Pen and the more fine tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later .,2,Neutral
3926,1836,2,If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it get the Note .,3,Positive
3927,1836,3,If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge .,1,Negative

3930,1838,0,If you want the S Pen then there are enough other small improvements to make it worth the price .,3,Positive

3936,1840,1,Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you can not get to the finger print scanner USB 3.1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features .,1,Negative

5697,2591,0,I agree that having the screen extending to all 4 edges would be cool but you wouldnt have anywhere on the front of the device that you can hold and I bet there would be a hell of a lot of accidental touches .,3,Positive

5707,2594,3,They managed to really simulate the feel of a click with haptic feedback .,1,Negative
5708,2594,4,So bottom line I would be all for this feature if similarly well executed replacing a physical home button on any and every phone its that well done .,1,Negative

5750,2620,0,I dont think itll drop permanently mostly cuz the Gear S3 i feel are just additional watches available to choose from just like when the Platinum and Rose Gold classics came out .,1,Negative
5751,2620,1,The S3 are bigger watches and so some people might not wan na buy it cuz they have smaller wrists .,1,Negative
5752,2620,2,Most likely itll just go on sale .,1,Negative
5753,2620,3,Source I work at Best Buy,3,Positive
5754,2621,0,Since Samsung seems to be looking to sell the original S2 alongside the new range I wouldnt be surprised to see a price drop the same time pricing and availability for the S3 is announced .,1,Negative
5755,2621,1,I wouldnt expect a major RRP drop from Samsung though as they may not want it to seem too much of a bargain against the S3 but retailers may differ in strategy .,1,Negative
5756,2621,2,On a side note I was holding off getting the classic on contract with O2 UK in anticipation of new models and have noticed its no longer an option on their website .,1,Negative

5770,2628,0,The specific rebuttal for Corning all glass falls between a Mohs hardness of 5 6 something which Pasansky told me has been validated several times during the development process here at Corning .,1,Negative
5771,2628,1,So a Mohs pick of 3 can not scratch glass with a hardness of 5 or 6 .,1,Negative
5772,2628,2,So far so busted .,3,Positive
5773,2628,3,Essentially any glass is at 5 6 and the Mohs pick was a 3 .,2,Neutral

5776,2628,6,I think that unless someone else does a similar test or JerryRigsEverything follows up with a significant cleaning effort we wont really know .,1,Negative
5777,2628,7,I suspect that the new Gorilla Glass traded scratching for material transfer .,1,Negative
5778,2628,8,If its impossible or nearly impossible to get this transferred material off of the glass ever try to clean sap off a painted car .,1,Negative
5779,2628,9,then it will amount to the same thing in the publics mind .,2,Neutral

5813,2645,1,The opinionated bit did irk me though .,1,Negative
5814,2646,0,Praise for the HTC 10 is probably from the fact that the author is in the middle of reviewing that device and had to drop what he was doing to push out a Note 7 review before going back to it .,1,Negative
5815,2646,1,Might just be what he compares it to since that is the other device he is most recently working with .,2,Neutral

5847,2654,2,As far as rooting goes the Android equivalent to jailbreak it means you and apps you specify have root access meaning if you wanted you could delete your system folder and watch the phone die but its super easy to restoreinstall ROMs on most Samsung phones as easy as flashing a ZIP file from your SD card and if I recall correctly the ATampT and T Mobile versions are rootable thanks to a leaked developer bootloader or something .,1,Negative

7186,3261,0,mind if I ask what AW lacks that the GS2 has .,2,Neutral
7187,3261,1,Do you preferuse the GS2 over the moto 360 .,2,Neutral
7188,3261,2,Because my main uses are going to be reading messagesnotifications at work and being able to send quick replies the GS2 seemed to be able to do what I needed ... though it will depend on whether it works seamlessly with whatsapp and messenger etc. .,1,Negative
7189,3261,3,I know the Huawei and the moto can also do this but the white screens on all the google notifications bothered me Id have really liked it if there was a dark theme available .,1,Negative
7190,3261,4,I have purchased a GS2 classic from amazon though I very nearly bought the Huawei instead .,1,Negative
7191,3261,5,However the Huawei is heavier and doesnt look like it would fit as nicely on smaller wrists .,2,Neutral

7195,3262,1,Fingers crossed .,2,Neutral

7204,3266,0,Ive had a Gear S2 for a week now not long enough for a detailed review .,1,Negative
7205,3266,1,But I am enjoying using it and am impressed with the automated activity detection and record keeping .,3,Positive
7206,3266,2,Heres my pros and cons list so far Pros No fuss activity detection and record keeping Excellent battery life even with always on watchface 18 hrs a day with 10 15 spare battery left My 3g model can independently take and make phone callstexts without having the phone present Excellent build quality Even though no Android watchfaces are available I think the Tizen stores selection is pretty good and there are amazingly configurable faces available for free or cheaply Charges fairly quickly The rotating bezel is not a gimmick its a genuine bright idea for small on wrist device navigation .,1,Negative
7207,3266,3,I cant believe every smartwatch doesnt offer this .,1,Negative
7208,3266,4,Builtin speaker 3g model is amazingly clear and functional both for calls and surprisingly even music for short periods .,3,Positive
7209,3266,5,Cons Not many useful apps on the Tizen store although I cant really say I am missing anything that would have been important to me given the decent builtin apps No way to enable always on while charging so useless as nightstand clock S Voice is in my opinion very nearly useless .,1,Negative
7210,3266,6,If youre at all fluent with Googles voice assistant you will be nothing but frustrated with it .,1,Negative
7211,3266,7,Ive simply given up on it entirely since I dont want to be frustrated the 80 to 90 percent of the time it doesnt work or does something even worse than failing Wake me in an hour correctly transcribed results in an alarm set for 1 a.m. My S2 Sport requires proprietary watchbands .,0,Verynegative
7212,3266,8,There are lots of online reports of band and connector failures which makes me nervous .,1,Negative
7213,3266,9,I got my watch free with my S7 phone but would buy an S2 Classic if I was purchasing one since it supports standard watchbands .,1,Negative
7214,3266,10,No 3rd party music streaming apps .,1,Negative
7215,3266,11,Must use Samsung Milk free with ads I rate 610 for function or move music tracks to device to listen to music from builtin speaker .,2,Neutral
7216,3266,12,Otherwise device can only control a phone based music app for listening on phone .,1,Negative
7217,3266,13,My take on your likely opinion of the Gear S2 You would like S Health just fine hate and quickly give up on S Voice and find a somewhat clunky workaround for reminders probably involving using your phone and settling for a notification on the watch .,1,Negative
7218,3266,14,Since the reminder thing and voice assistant seem fairly high on your checklist I believe youd probably be happier with Android wear .,1,Negative
7219,3267,0,Definitely battery life .,3,Positive

7221,3267,2,Wireless charging .,2,Neutral

7223,3268,1,Battery life on my normal S7 Verizon is the best Ive had since flip phones .,3,Positive
7224,3268,2,My biggest change has been my internet browser since I used the stock AOSP browser on my S3 with the quick control lab settings .,1,Negative
7225,3268,3,Nothing really compares to that convenience but it used an outdated protocol and webpages definitely load faster and more reliably now .,1,Negative
7226,3268,4,Second biggest change is the menu button is now the recent apps button and long pressing the home button pulls up Google Now .,1,Negative
7227,3268,5,Double tapping the home button goes to camera and its so convenient I dont even have the camera app on my homescreen anymore .,1,Negative
7228,3268,6,There are no lockscreen widgets anymore but theres some headway on that with GoodLock through the Galaxy Apps store if its important to you .,1,Negative
7229,3268,7,There are also themes and icon packs if you dont like the look of your system but I havent bothered to change mine yet .,2,Neutral
7230,3269,0,I literally did this yesterday except I got the Edge .,2,Neutral
7231,3269,1,The phone itself is really nice its fast has a lot more RAM the screen in beautiful but having such a high resolution it can be hard to find wallpapers that arent fuzzy .,2,Neutral
7232,3269,2,I use a lot of Youtube and Twitch on my phone so when the content is like 720p or lower it is really noticeable .,1,Negative
7233,3269,3,The thing is though that is in no way the phones fault but I thought I should mention it coming from the S3 .,1,Negative
7234,3269,4,The new up to date OS can take some getting used to but everything is pretty well laid out it didnt take long to figure the ins and outs and get it set up how I like it .,1,Negative
7235,3269,5,I dont know if you are planning to get an Edge but if you are interested you should put a lot of thought into it .,2,Neutral
7236,3269,6,I still dont know how I feel about it its weird seeing pictures and videos warp into small bends and with it being a much bigger phone you pretty much have to completely change how you hold and use it just to avoid hitting those edges .,1,Negative
7237,3269,7,The main reason I chose the Edge though is just because it is bigger than the regular S7 and I felt I was getting ripped of if I didnt get the bigger size but now I think that if you care about size that much just go for the Note 5 .,1,Negative
7238,3269,8,Overall I am happy with it and I am hoping to get a good 3 4 years out of it and I think it is very nice coming from an S3 .,3,Positive

7310,3302,1,snapdragon is limited to US and China,2,Neutral
7311,3303,0,I work in a Carphone Warehouse retailer in the UK and I can confirm that there will be no Edge Due to the S6 Edge selling many more units than the S6 Edge they have decided that they are not going to release a smaller sized Edge as the distinguishing feature of a larger display is what drove sales of the S6 Edge This coming from a Samsung Field Rep who had the Galaxy S7 weeks in advance of its release .,1,Negative
7312,3304,0,Itll probably be a 6 hopefully i mean its been done on other phone b4,1,Negative
7313,3305,0,It doesnt look like there will be an Edge model this year .,2,Neutral
7314,3306,0,I seen on YouTube that people got confused on naming of the Galaxy S6 Edge and the Edge that for this year they made it simpler by just having a Galaxy S7 Edge which is 0.2 inches smaller than the S6 Edge but it packs a huge battery .,3,Positive
7315,3307,0,I saw a patent filed for a case that holds an spen .,2,Neutral
7316,3307,1,Ive got a sneaky suspicion the s7 edge will launch .,3,Positive
7317,3307,2,With spen case sold separately and the the note range as we know it will come to an end,1,Negative
7318,3308,0,Seems theyve refined their product line .,1,Negative
7319,3308,1,S6S6 Edge being the smaller phones with only a difference in the edge and S6 EdgeNote 5 being so similar with difference in edge must have been very confusing for the average consumer .,1,Negative
7320,3308,2,Those products had little variation before .,2,Neutral
7321,3308,3,Now there is the S7 the bigger S7 Edge to differentiate from that and I assume the next Note will take up the sole Phablet spot .,1,Negative
7322,3308,4,3 flagship phones in 3 different sizes makes more sense .,2,Neutral
7323,3308,5,Most telling in the refinement is that it seems only the 32GB option will be available in most of the bigger countries .,1,Negative
7324,3308,6,Hopefully this means we wont see a repeat of demand outweighing supply as it did when the S6 Edge was first released .,3,Positive
7325,3308,7,Samsung really suffered from that .,1,Negative
7326,3309,0,I was really hoping for the plus version too .,2,Neutral

7360,3323,3,Just wish they add a slot for micro SD can live without extra battery .,1,Negative
7361,3323,4,Dont even really use that feature on my note 4 tbh .,1,Negative
7362,3324,0,For the first picture that looks nothing like the recent rendering leak plus a huge step away from current design style flash below the camera instead of next to the camera huge ugly chrome trim around the camera s6 generation background image .,1,Negative
7363,3324,1,Second image more in line with current design style but a bit boxy trim around camera goes around flash plus a new sensor also looks a bit boxy icons are old style icons .,1,Negative
7364,3324,2,These are two fan generated images that will look nothing like the final product .,1,Negative
7365,3324,3,As for the text The Samsung Galaxy S7 flagship will probably be powered by a system on a chip that benchmarks quicker than the Apple A9 SoC .,1,Negative
7366,3324,4,However the South Korean cellphone maker is working laboriously to make sure over heating is not a problem .,2,Neutral
7367,3324,5,Well color me shocked .,2,Neutral
7368,3324,6,Theyre trying to make product that is better than current offerings ... Odd I thought companies aimed to make products with worse specs every year .,1,Negative
7369,3324,7,We are also informed by rumor mongers that it ll be 10 cheaper than the present S6 .,1,Negative
7370,3324,8,That s an aggressive pricing move from the android market leader .,2,Neutral
7371,3324,9,Samsung could very well be looking to be more competitive price wise but without a reasonable source or without any supply chain clues hinting at this I doubt it .,1,Negative
7372,3324,10,Within the USA and China the Samsung Galaxy S7 will get the brand new Qualcomm 820 SoC which is instead of the more apparent chip choice Samsung s own Exynos line .,1,Negative
7373,3324,11,And it will be clocked at some kind of ludicrous speed we are informed outfitted with a heat pipe based cooling system .,1,Negative
7374,3324,12,Samsung typically goes with Qualcomm .,3,Positive
7375,3324,13,That was all the big news about the S6 line using their Exynos line something about the 810 overheating so Samsung went with their own chip .,2,Neutral
7376,3324,14,If Qualcomm has the heating issue under control or if Samsung has found a way to keep it cool then theyll probably go back to them .,1,Negative

7378,3324,16,No names and random people .,2,Neutral

7381,3324,19,They will introduce new features to make your phone experience better and aim to outdo Apple .,3,Positive

7707,3464,3,Yeah I know your watch doesnt use Android wear but for some reason that fixed it .,1,Negative
7708,3464,4,You just have to install it I dont even think you have to open it .,1,Negative

7720,3467,0,That wont happen .,2,Neutral
7721,3467,1,Thats the reason it runs Tizen instead of AW because Samsung wants to integrate its own appsservices .,1,Negative
7722,3467,2,Thats a drawback for sure but not a dealbreaker for me .,1,Negative
7723,3467,3,The reason is because for a smartwatch I really notice no difference between Tizen and OS in everyday use .,1,Negative
7724,3467,4,It palys nicer with S Health Phone and Messages Calendar etc. .,1,Negative
7725,3467,5,When I had Moto 360 of course Google apps like Keep which I really wish was on S2 integrated really well into AW .,1,Negative
7726,3467,6,But the drawback of that is that it didnt play nice with the stock Samsung apps .,1,Negative

7838,3515,1,If youre thinking of upgrading I would wait a few more weeks because the S7 is due to be revealed soon but if you want to wait a few months to hear how it lasts I can understand I did the same before upgrading from my S5 to S6 .,1,Negative

8214,3674,4,Can any bro help me .,2,Neutral
8215,3674,5,Thank you very much .,3,Positive
8216,3675,0,This is why you should always buy the device insurance when you buy a new phone .,1,Negative
8217,3675,1,Its easier to cancel insurance after you know its in proper working order than it is to go threw the hoops of a full warranty replacement .,1,Negative
8218,3675,2,Unfortunately for you it also seems to be a bit to late for insurance but depending on who you got the replacement phone from you might be able to take it back to your carriers outlet location and just exchange it on the claim that its a complete lemon .,1,Negative
8219,3675,3,Regarding the battery stop using it immediately .,1,Negative
8220,3675,4,If thats the only battery you have then you better off not using it at all .,1,Negative
8221,3675,5,you are putting yourselves at risk just plugging it in at night .,1,Negative
8222,3675,6,With the drain symptoms and the fact that it gets hot while charging indicates to me that you have a shorting problem somewhere in the battery .,1,Negative
8223,3675,7,It might not be catastrophic yet but that doesnt mean that it wont explode the next time you put it on charge .,1,Negative
8224,3675,8,Save yourself and your stuff from fire damage by just writing off the battery .,1,Negative
8225,3675,9,Last I checked the S6 batteries retailed from Samsung proper at about 45 50 .,1,Negative
8226,3675,10,you could also buy an aftermarket extended battery for 60 80 that would double or even triple the capacity of the factory batteries though they use the same firmware and will still register a drain down to 15 until the battery completely zeros out even though extended batteries would be at 60 or more so theres that ... when I bought my Galaxy S4 I had a similar problem with a cracked screen because I dropped it while changing into uniform at work .,1,Negative
8227,3675,11,On hard tile .,2,Neutral
8228,3675,12,It was a hair line crack but something I knew would grow into a spiderweb a crossed the screen .,2,Neutral
8229,3675,13,I managed to convince Samsung that I didnt notice the defect until I pulled off the protective film and they let me send it in for a free screen replacement .,1,Negative
8230,3675,14,This was also within 30 days of getting it in the mail .,2,Neutral
8231,3675,15,Depending on who you got your replacement from either the manufacturer or your carrier you might be able to pull this off if its still within 30 90 days of getting the phone .,2,Neutral
8232,3675,16,Though if you combine it with your battery problems you might run into issues seeing as heat is something that is not covered in the basic warranty .,1,Negative
8233,3675,17,Also the reason why your battery is not covered under the devices warranty is because its technicaly its own device .,1,Negative
8234,3675,18,Its Samsung made and Samsung has a warranty for the battery but its not covered in the general device warranty .,1,Negative
8235,3675,19,If you call up the handset department and complain about this then they will try and pull your device warranty out from under you but if you call the battery department and complain about the battery specifically then you might get somewhere as far as getting it replaced .,1,Negative
8236,3675,20,You have to do your research on this as I have also had to do this with a Toshiba laptop that had a Samsung battery and actually find the proper number or transfer when you are connected with a human being on the support line dont call the warranty claims department because thats like asking for a lawyer to be eavesdropping on the conversation hope that info helps .,1,Negative
8237,3676,0,Try to escalate the issue .,2,Neutral
8238,3676,1,I dont know what country youre in but in Australia batteries are covered by a 12 month warranty .,1,Negative
8239,3676,2,In fact S6S7 batteries should be covered for 24 months because theyre built into the phone .,1,Negative
8240,3676,3,They wont just provide another warranty replacement at least .,1,Negative
8241,3676,4,The warranty does not cover physical damage software rooted devices or liquid damage but manufacturing defects should absolutely be covered .,1,Negative
8242,3676,5,Hope you get this sorted .,1,Negative

8666,3852,0,TLDR If you want a stylish watch and arent too concerned about functionality then you wont be disappointed with the Classic .,1,Negative
8667,3852,1,Ive been using my Gear S2 Classic for about a week now .,1,Negative
8668,3852,2,Here are my 2cents .,2,Neutral
8669,3852,3,Aside from the obvious hardware differences between the S2 Regular and Classic eg fact that the Classic doesnt have a 3G4G option the Classic kind of pulled the short stick in the app department .,1,Negative
8670,3852,4,I didnt really care a whole lot about the functionality of the watch as much as I did about the aesthetics so the fact that there isnt a dedicated e mail app isnt a huge deal to me but it is kind of disappointing .,0,Verynegative
8671,3852,5,There also isnt an icon for the messaging app so if you didnt dig through the settings youd think there was no Message app .,1,Negative
8672,3852,6,By going to SettingsDeviceDouble Press Home and selecting options you can bring up the message app to scroll through received messages and reply to them .,1,Negative
8673,3852,7,Otherwise youd have to create a new message with the Buddy or Phone app because the notifications dont give you an option to reply to the message directly from the devices notification screen which really sucks .,1,Negative
8674,3852,8,And while you reply to an e mail from the notification screen you cant scroll through your e mails because there is no e mail app .,1,Negative
8675,3852,9,Id also really like to see a hangouts app .,3,Positive
8676,3852,10,I havent done much else with the other apps but generally speaking the functionality of this watch is kind of disappointing but Im hoping an update will quell my issues .,1,Negative
8677,3852,11,The battery life isnt great on this device .,3,Positive
8678,3852,12,I dont get a whole lot of messages or calls so the watch will last a day or two before it needs to be recharged .,3,Positive
8679,3852,13,Ive just gotten into the habit of recharging it every night before I got to bed but I could easily see the battery being too low to last through the night after a day of heavy usage .,1,Negative
8680,3852,14,That being said this is the first smart watch that looks really good to me .,4,Verypositive
8681,3852,15,The fact that you can swap out the wrist band with any other 20mm sized bands is awesome and I love being able to check notifications without having to pull out my phone .,3,Positive
8682,3852,16,I just wish I could do a little more .,1,Negative
8683,3853,0,About a year a go I bought a Gear 2 Neo on a bit of a whim .,1,Negative
8684,3853,1,At he back of my mind I thought Id use it for a bit and then the novelty would wear off but I find it actually pretty useful .,1,Negative
8685,3853,2,I cycle a lot so its good to be able to see texts and email while on the bike and answer calls .,4,Verypositive
8686,3853,3,I find the timer and alarm function really handy and the fitness tracker aspect is also pretty good .,3,Positive
8687,3853,4,Im currently considering upgrading to a S2 Classic .,2,Neutral
