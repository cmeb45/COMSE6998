I have been a paying member of Flickr for years. Really, one of the few properties of Yahoo's that was worth anything (like Yahoo Finance). My 25.00 per year allowed me unlimited uploads, access to the original file after uploading and other niceties (promotional pricing on gift items, badge, extra month's free, etc.). Flickr became my primary storage location for all digital images taken since 2000. 

Then a couple of years ago Yahoo announced they're improving Flickr by offering all the benefits of a Pro member to the free accounts. And I can still continue paying 25.00 a year because nothing will change for Pro members. So, basically I am allowed to donate money to MM's baby fund and get nothing in return.

The kicker is that to pay for the loss of Pro accounts going to free accounts all Flicker pages had advertisements on them and a hideous Yahoo banner across the top with links to other Yahoo sites. Fortunately, both the banner and the ads are no-longer visible on the main Flickr pages. 

Yahoo needs to focus on the properties that generate income like Flickr, Yahoo Finance, and the totally botched Delicious site (thankfully donated to another company); charge a reasonable fee for these services; and stop trying to tie everything together.

No matter how relevant to the user, it's weird that Yahoo aggregates a message board on a video game site for news, and even weirder that it considers the content potentially front page worthy. I mean, it seems like a technical thing, where your bots or whatever are maybe supposed to crawl ign.com for video game news, but you're accidentally crawling their forums, too.

Edit because the OP wasn't too clear: You had a front page ""article"" linking to a kid's post on a video game site, where you presented the conspiracy theory laden title of his post as a legitimate news headline.

181,"Today I tested the web version of new YM, and it turned out to be better than expected despite hearing lots of complaints. Now I understand why they decided to shut down old YM for good. The reason is that new YM and old YM are currently linked, but the linking does not work properly unless BOTH the SENDER and the RECEIVER activate their account on the new platform. If your friend has never logged into new YM, you will notice that a lot of messages will not show up on new YM if you send from old YM, and vice versa. Once both chatters have logged into new YM once (once is all it needs), the synchronization between new YM and old YM works perfectly. And once everyone migrates to new YM, this issue should automatically be solved. Hopefully this will create enough user base for it to get a desktop version like FB chat did.

245,"Not happened to me yet, but I will give up yahoo when it does. The ""new"" client, which I tried.. is just the web version wrapped in a windows app .. it's literally the web version in a mini browser..

It has zero features right now.. you can't see who's on or offline, you can't group contacts.. and what is the most DISTURBING thing is I use the old client that does NOT upload your history to yahoo .. I'm all about privacy so I avoided the updates that archived them to their servers.. yet when I installed this new and ""improved"" version.. all of my chat history was there despite having all history disabled and uninstalling the old one before thew new..  NOT cool ..

So I uninstalled the new version, went to the previous versions site ( google  ) and got an old version and reinstalled it.. it let me sign in.. but it's no wonder only 1 contact shows up anymore... after this crap I'll be done with Yahoo forever.. they destroyed their search finally by making it bing with a face lift, they destroyed their homepage before that by cluttering it with everything they could cram in... they destroyed everything they ever tried to do .. and now that they sold their property, the newbies are trying to dumb it down .. ""Can I clicky the button and talky to the person thing? OH YAH! yay!"" .. no thanks.. I hated AIM for years, they sued me for an an AI project I did ( which was mentioned on slashdot YEARS ago ) .. icqbot.net for those who've been around.. but yahoo is still compatible with third party clients so it's simple, easy and not the crap this is.. and I never thought I'd say that since I always preferred Yahoo after ICQ ( before ICQ sucked ) .. I think honestly AOL learned their lesson after trying to revamp ICQ .. ICQ was the leader at one point.. now it's unknown

Anyway... I'll be slipping to AOL only.. only because I have to still use AOL for work.. Yahoo can suck it.. ",2016-08-11 04:00:09,Just got booted from Yahoo! Messenger
