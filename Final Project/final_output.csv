43,I just called Samsung uk to tell them this not in those words exactly but since our alternative solutions to the note 7 problem are just to get a refund and a new contract I asked if theres any way an actual solution like this could happen After some talking and being left on hold while she discussed with a manager she genuinely I hope made a note on my account and said to wait for a call back It might be that they are not aware that this sort of solution would help to make the situation better for note 7 users Id advise everyone in this situation call Samsung and let them know this option of getting a replacement s7 phone and an automatic upgrade when a new model is released would convince you to stay with Samsung and return your note 7 It might at least help to make this a reality,0.0,2016-09-07 09:52:04

61,I was wondering what was the time frame we had to exchange our phones Like theoretically use the free exchange as some sort of insurance policy Hold on to your original Note 7 until the very last day of the turn in period so just in case your phone should break in one way or another during that time frame you would basically get a new one for free,0.0,2016-08-16 19:29:53

322,My S8 hopes 1 Dont be afraid to make it slightly thicker for a larger battery Seriously if companies like Xiaomi can have a 4050mAh battery for their own Note phones that cost much less Samsung should go all out No one buys phone X because its 0 7mm thinner than phone Y 2 More reduction of bloatware I cant stand redundant apps like Camera amp Magnifier For other apps that hardly people ever use like S Health or Samsung Gear DO NOT pre install them If they need apps to sync with other devices like the Samsung smartwatch let them download them upon syncing rather than pre installing them 3 One up Apple further by setting a default 64GB storage 4 The default apps amp settings visuals should take more cue from the Black Theme darker colors so less battery life is being consumed Sure consumers can manually change to the all black theme but the average general public are somewhat too dumb for that I have a handful of relativesfriends who dont know about this5 Yes dual cameras nuff said 6 4GB RAM and disable the loading animations You can manually do them in Developer Mode but again how much do the general public know Of course all that and VR performance and non exploding batteries would be enough to knock Apple of its spot,0.0,2016-09-12 19:32:30

862,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you may have the USB 3 speeds On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere And none of those will work on the new phone However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier,0.0,2016-08-06 14:00:29

1179,There is nothing the S7 Edge can do that the Note 7 couldnt The Note 7 is pretty much a slightly bigger slightly improved and slightly more refined S7 Edge with an S Pen The difference is really only about 100 and not 200 like you stated talking about new Its really a question of if you use S Pen or not There just isnt enough differentiating feature and I wouldnt even say the price is that big of a difference between the 2 phones,0.0,2016-03-03 08:01:20
1180,At least in the US the official unlocked version is 779 and Note 7 is 850 which is what the US unlocked version of Note 7 will cost once it releases in couple of months What S7 edge costs 650 Are you talking about the international unlocked models without warranty Samsung pay dont work etc So its definitely worth 70 to 100 actual price difference,0.0,2016-01-27 17:51:54
1181,If you would utilize full use out of the pen yes Plus it still has some features the S7 doesnt have I heard the sound quality is improved thats a mouth to ear thing though My justification of getting it is that I heavily used the pen It was great at writing quick notes easy place to have a quick screen grab and I just always used it for a multitude of things I didnt use it a lot early on but I spent time with it and made it a habit to use and I realized that the s pen is much more than a regular stylus It is a proper functionality feature that has a hell lot of potential for the Note,0.0,2016-01-27 19:56:09

1184,Is a s pen worth 200 to you,1.0,2016-01-11 16:27:45
1185,It depends on your use case The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen has the iris scanner as a security option and of course the greatly improved S Pen and the more fine tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it get the Note If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge Theyre both great phones it just depends on what feel is the most important part some more features or saving money,0.0,2016-01-05 19:43:58
1186,If you want the S Pen then there are enough other small improvements to make it worth the price However if you dont like the S Pen then I dont think those small improvements are enough to justify 100 200 by themselves,0.0,2016-09-29 18:16:29
1187,Easily worth the extra 200 Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you can not get to the finger print scanner USB 3 1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features I would pay more for anyone of those but to add them all together is a bargain for 200,1.0,2016-09-29 15:50:16

1271,If thats the only two phones you are looking at then S7 for sure You wont see a massive difference in performance since there is no 10nm yet But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7 I suggest this because Google phones are updated and most secure android phones you will ever find,0.0,2016-07-26 12:45:46

1278,I switched from a 6s to an S7 love it High quality phone for sure The screen is glorious gorilla glass too,1.0,2016-07-26 14:55:06
1279,I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7 having to return it under the recall I really never got used to the edge thing and battery life was not near even my 2 year old 6 but it was OK I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time Battery life is also kinda short depending on what the phone is doing but it feels like less than the 6 most of the time I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor Nirvana to me would be Android OS on an iPhone For now Im going back to iPhone not because Im in love with the OS or the customer hostile attitude but just because I feel like I can have the thing for years and know that it wont explode or shatter or mysteriously die without it at least being under a better warranty than mail it in and wait 2 weeks while we find a way to blame you Assuming youre not concerned about the build quality then the S7 is a fine phone Its bigger than the non plusses and large enough that I can still fat finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it If you can overlook the neon glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing Ive seen especially at night when the black screen background is black And being able to get content on and off of it without iTunes cancer is miraculous in and of itself Chrome on Android kills Safari even on IOS 10 IMO I dont think youd be missing anything going to the S7 if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem As long as it doesnt explode or shatter Also compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster most of the time there is no waiting for things to load but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device,0.0,2016-07-26 11:08:22

1284,I recently came from an iPhone 6 to an S7 Edge It is an amazing phone and Im not worried about newer phones like the S8 coming out This is because there isnt really anything that this phone is missing It has a bloody massive battery great screen micro SD card support IP68 water resistance etc The S8 will most likely have the new iris scanner but honestly a finger print scanner is more practical and probably faster What Im saying is that the S7 difference from an S8 wont be that big especially when you previously used an iPhone,0.0,2016-07-25 07:50:42

1616,Short answer no not anytime soon Someone will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that intel owns the x86 platform and allows AMD to make chip sets using that architecture they get something out of it cant remember what though So a few years ago there was rumors that Samsung was going to buy AMD and Intel gently reminded AMD that if they got bought they would no longer be able to use it or something along those lines and the deal fell apart So Samsung chugs along making their Exynos chip for the mobile market because android plays nicely I guess I heard that the chromebook they made with the Exynos processor was a pain because the chromium OS is x86 based,0.0,2016-04-29 19:15:14
1617,it wouldnt be for awhile but a lot of things could happen over time to change this Microsoft is developing Windows as a universal platform which no longer relies on X86 to compete with the ever growing popularity of Android and Ios and none of them need x86 It really just depends what defines a PC for you Both google and apple are working on multitasking to take their mobile OS to the next level to work as desktops with easy multitasking As for gaming you wouldnt get the massive backlog of Direct X games until someone figures out how to portemulate but if devs choose to use vulkan games could run on them,0.0,2016-04-30 01:36:53
1618,Samsung is really focused on the mobile and embedded markets Thats where ARM architecture shines The simpler architecture cheaper license and lower powerheat management requirements just cant be beat They have experimented with Intel in a tablet the Tab 3 10 1 and it was underwhelming They do make laptops and desktop PCs in some markets but in the US its a very small part of their business ARM is used in their TVs Phones Watches and a variety of home appliances,0.0,2016-04-30 01:37:43
1619,Samsung is great my wife tried Apple twice and is officially done with them Once we get our school checks we are hopping back to Samsung I will admit Samsung has dropped the ball a bit with doing things The S7 is a bounce back to the top for them Note 7 I am iffy with I am part of the phablet community of die hards Im just iffy with the battery The size needs to be complimented with the battery because there will be more demand on it Luckily I am getting it in September so I will have some time to hear from consumers and see how the phone plays out I am excited for the new features I just wish they added onto the old ones I dont mind a 12mp camera but please up the processor and RAM because those are advancing big now and they should have jumped on that when phones are going beyond that soon or already I hope they come out with a versionlike how Apple does the advanced versions of their iPhones and they do that stuff Phone isnt even out yet so no one really has an accurate idea on how its performing in the market,0.0,2016-04-30 08:31:16
1620,You dont need to go Samsung ecosystem Just Android I owned iPhone since the 3GS this is my first SamsungAndroid phone and I went all in I have a Nvidia shield Huawei watch and a Samsung tablet I also have 2 gear s2s Samsung makes the best Android phone imo and the Galaxy is always going to be comparable to the iPhone Your really investing in the Android eco system and its great I still use a Windows computer and laptop though But it works fine with Android and now windows 10 will allow actionable notifications with Android phones Samsung does have a first party solution in side sync also which I use currently I like the gear s2 but my android wear is better imo,0.0,2016-04-29 21:51:11
1621,I switched from iphone 6 to the s7 edge last week and Im loving it so far As mentioned already its more of switching to the android ecosystem rather than Samsung The good thing about android is that its flexible so if you wanted to continue to use icloud you can download a 3rd party app that lets you sync to it I genuinely dont miss a thing from apple anything and everything I could do on the iPhone I can do with the s7 edge And touchwiz really isnt a problem anymore,0.0,2016-05-01 16:39:19

1731,I dont think itll drop permanently mostly cuz the Gear S3 i feel are just additional watches available to choose from just like when the Platinum and Rose Gold classics came out The S3 are bigger watches and so some people might not wan na buy it cuz they have smaller wrists Most likely itll just go on sale Source I work at Best Buy,0.0,2016-09-18 11:16:32
1732,Since Samsung seems to be looking to sell the original S2 alongside the new range I wouldnt be surprised to see a price drop the same time pricing and availability for the S3 is announced I wouldnt expect a major RRP drop from Samsung though as they may not want it to seem too much of a bargain against the S3 but retailers may differ in strategy On a side note I was holding off getting the classic on contract with O2 UK in anticipation of new models and have noticed its no longer an option on their website Im hoping that means the S3 isnt too far away Although I would have quite happily gone with the classic knowing the new ones arent that much of a major upgrade Id hope Samsung would bring the software enhancements to the S2 Eventually,0.0,2016-09-07 14:01:53

1755,The Google Play Store will have just about any app youre looking for Its pretty straightforward apps in categories and there are plenty of options for anything you might be trying to do As far as rooting goes the Android equivalent to jailbreak it means you and apps you specify have root access meaning if you wanted you could delete your system folder and watch the phone die but its super easy to restoreinstall ROMs on most Samsung phones as easy as flashing a ZIP file from your SD card and if I recall correctly the ATampT and T Mobile versions are rootable thanks to a leaked developer bootloader or something However its been a few weeks since Ive looked into any of that as all my attention has been on the unannounced Galaxy Note7,0.0,2016-09-04 17:12:29
