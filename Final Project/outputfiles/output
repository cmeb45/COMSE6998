78,78,As USB C cables can go in either way the design of the ridges are no longer needed .,1,Negative
79,79,Would look pretty weird with ridges on both sides and having it on one side would habituate people into plugging in USB C cables only one way .,1,Negative
80,80,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag.On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you _ may _ have the USB 3 speeds.On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere .,1,Negative
81,81,And none of those will work on the new phone.However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new.Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C.Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier .,1,Negative

27,27,The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen has the iris scanner as a security option and of course the greatly improved S Pen and the more fine tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later.If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it get the Note .,2,Neutral

2,2,The S7 is a top phone .,3,Positive
3,3,Waiting for S8 If thats the only two phones you are looking at then S7 for sure.You wont see a massive difference in performance since there is no 10nm yet.But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October.Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7.I suggest this because Google phones are updated and most secure android phones you will ever find .,1,Negative
4,4,I am in the same predicament .,1,Negative
5,5,I was gon na go with the note 7 I always wait for the storm to ride out as I call it the beta test and thankfully so .,1,Negative

10,10,Wait for the S8 .,2,Neutral
11,11,.,2,Neutral
12,12,It will be awesome and announced earlier .,2,Neutral
13,13,The s8 is reportedly going to be out Q1 or Q2 2017 depends if you can wait that long .,1,Negative
14,14,The s8 will be better than the s7 but the s7 is still a top notch phone I think really at this point the S7 has everything you need .,3,Positive
15,15,I personally went with the S7 Edge .,2,Neutral
16,16,But wireless charging water resistant great camera great screen its really the whole package .,3,Positive
17,17,Only thing lacking if you could even call it lacking USB C .,1,Negative
18,18,If you can just wait it out .,2,Neutral
19,19,The s8 will obviously be better and even if you dont like it you can get an s7 for cheaper by then I am with U.S. Cellular they are the only coverage in my rural area and they have a pretty limited phone selection .,1,Negative
20,20,They dont sell the Moto phones anymore which would be my second choice .,2,Neutral

23,23,High quality phone for sure .,3,Positive
24,24,The screen is glorious ... gorilla glass too I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7 having to return it under the recall .,1,Negative
25,25,I really never got used to the edge thing and battery life was not near even my 2 year old 6 but it was OK .,1,Negative
26,26,I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time .,0,Verynegative
27,27,Battery life is also kinda short depending on what the phone is doing but it feels like less than the 6 most of the time .,1,Negative
28,28,I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation .,1,Negative
29,29,I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair.Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones .,1,Negative
30,30,Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor .,1,Negative
31,31,Nirvana to me would be Android OS on an iPhone.For now Im going back to iPhone not because Im in love with the OS or the customer hostile attitude but just because I feel like I can have the thing for years and know that it wont explode or shatter or mysteriously die without it at least being under a better warranty than mail it in and wait 2 weeks while we find a way to blame you.Assuming youre not concerned about the build quality then the S7 is a fine phone .,2,Neutral
32,32,Its bigger than the non plusses and large enough that I can still fat finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it .,1,Negative
33,33,If you can overlook the neon glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing Ive seen especially at night when the black screen background is ... black .,3,Positive

36,36,I dont think youd be missing anything going to the S7 if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem .,1,Negative
37,37,As long as it doesnt explode or shatter.Also ... compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster ... most of the time there is no waiting for things to load but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device .,1,Negative
38,38,I am in the same bloody boat .,1,Negative
39,39,Currently using Note5 wanted to get a Note7 when it came out but then the phones were recalled and whole exploding battery fiasco thing kind of scared me .,1,Negative
40,40,Decided to go for an iPhone7 but seeing the reviews and even the speed tests I am not sure it is worth the money and I am back to block 1 .,1,Negative
41,41,Should I get the Note7 when it launches with safe batteries get an S7 Edge or wait for an S8 .,1,Negative
42,42,So fucking torn between these three choices If only it wasnt ATampT exclusive .,1,Negative
43,43,Id consider it if there was an unlocked International version .,1,Negative
