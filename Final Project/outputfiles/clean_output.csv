435,My S6E was the phone that got me excited about phones again after the fall of Motorola.I just want Blue Coral .,Negative

438,Yeah lets hope if all goes well then this could be my very first Samsung phone.Was gunna be the note 7 but ya know shit happened .,Negative
442,They pushed out an update that prevented it from charging above 60 percent .,Negative
443,Then the Gear VR pushed out an update to prevent the Note 7 from being able to be used in the device .,Negative
444,No reason that they cant completely cripple it .,Negative
446,In other words blacklist them all just like they would if it was a stolen phone .,Negative
447,For liability purposes you would think that at some point they almost have to do that .,Negative
448,Somewhere out there you could in theory have someone who doesnt know about a recall .,Negative
451,As much as I would like to see a Note styled S8 I really doubt theyd have a model done for the launch febmarch .,Negative
453,But I dont necessarily buy phones because they look pretty .,Negative
454,I dont know of one person who has an edge phone that doesnt wish it was flat .,Negative

501,I sold my g3 19 rtf2 with gills last year for 1k .,Negative
502,I felt naked without my Glock I almost prefer the free charger to the fast wireless chargers I have just because the regular charger doesnt seem as finicky when placing the phone on it to charge The offer has already expired but if you use Pay before the end of the month you can get a 30 gift card for a couple stores Ebay Whole Foods Nike or BestBuy I got a charger from for 4 Works greathttp Yep got mine yesterday .,Negative
503,Seems to work really nice w my 7 edge .,Negative
504,Sounds like you need to contact Samsung and file a claim with USPS or FedEx .,Negative
505,Either someone stole your packages or they were delivered to the wrong address .,Negative
506,For the last promo FedEx delivered my wireless chargers to my next door neighbors door step so check with your neighbors and be sure to file a complaint if they delivered to the wrong address .,Negative
507,I see theyve fancied it up since I got one last year for my Note5 .,Positive
514,So at least thats something 2 deleted 50 off isnt even a great deal some people were under the impression it was going to be nearly freeDunno about korea but pretty much anywhere else you can sell a year old phone for at least half the value which is essentially what theyre offering as compensation for a major fuck upHere in Canada the S7E has a trade in value of 325 currently with every new flagship release they have a 150 200 discount if you trade in a phone and that combines with the trade in value of your phone so thats a 525 discount if the value doesnt dropUnless I misinterpreted the offer and you dont have to trade in your phone then its still pretty ass since youll have to sell it anyway if youre getting a new phone cool story Very disappointed its not for everyone still using Samsung devices and Im on an Edge plan with Verizon .,Negative
515,I went with an S7 Edge and Im actually not too torn with the direction theyre taking this .,Negative
516,I mean they are giving us Samsung loyalists for lack of a better term 50 the newest phone via trade in .,Negative

538,Not surprising its selling so well .,Positive
539,I do love my S7 Edge .,Positive
542,I have no idea .,Negative
543,I think Samsung did the right thing in recalling all of the devices and they shouldnt be liable for the carriers charges seeing as the carrier and Samsung are two distinct entities with different business operations .,Negative
545,Edit to kill off Note brand_id86498 .,Negative
547,Maybe in a year or two Ill reevaluate after I see how Samsung has handled things and what direction Google is headed with their project .,Positive
548,I dont buy it .,Negative
549,90 of Note 7 owners got replacement Note 7s with the first recall.And your title is wrong .,Negative
550,The online survey was done among Samsung phone owners not Note 7 owners .,Negative
551,It likely captures a bunch of clueless consumers who dont actually have Samsung phones .,Negative
553,These survey dont mean shit when youre only surveying a very small percentage of Note 7 owners .,Negative
554,A survey of 1000 people doesnt say much Im taking a long break from them .,Negative
555,The note 7 was the first phone Samsung made that I really liked .,Positive
556,I have no interest in the s7 or s7e and I doubt Ill have any interest in any of their phones for awhile .,Negative
557,No just a very very very small of those devices 3.4 failures per million is 6 sigma the problem is that they dont know where it is failing .,Negative
558,Since they cant reproduce the failure .,Negative

570,Definitely not getting the same treatment here in Canada .,Negative
571,I called my service provider today and they told me I have to ship the device back expense out of pocket or bring it back to the point of purchase which is far from where I live .,Negative
572,I paid to have the device shipped to my house in the first place and now I have to pay to ship it back because the device they offer explodes .,Negative

576,Got my phone back and the displayed battery life dropped dramatically after update.So I just got my note 7 shipped to me today .,Negative
577,Went online and confirmed via the MEI number and everything .,Positive
578,Weird thing though .,Negative
579,The battery power was at 43 when I started the software update .,Positive
581,Im betting Samsung just flashed new software in all the replacement units and sent them right back out the door .,Negative
582,Their fix for those who had not yet replaced their phones was a software update that would not allow the phone to be charged above 60 of capacity .,Negative
583,The iPhone 7 is a marketing disaster with the jack gone and as always with apple no goddamn important new feature except that its a cheap cashgrab as always with apple and the Note 7 literally a safety hazard ... I guess youre right Noticed this myself today .,Negative

588,The curve screen still turns me off I consider this Note 7 to actually be the 6 cuz of the bad luck its had .,Negative
589,Just cant skip it .,Negative
590,how can they tell its the battery being drained faster and not the limit Samsung is now putting onto how much charge the battery can even hold .,Negative
591,Didnt they reduce the capacity .,Negative
592,I believe they made the s5 mini without a flap and Im fairly sure it is still water resistant .,Negative
593,My girlfriend has the S5 and personally I like it a lot more then the S6 .,Positive
594,Where as the S6 does have its pros I think it tried to be to much like an iPhone and strip away some of its key features that made is a galaxy Id also wish for a device that was CIT customer interface test tested and with an IMEI that can be linked to the date of manufacturing.Since my first S5 wasnt CIT tested and the IMEI for my Tab S says it was manufactured 43 days after I purchased it .,Negative
595,I miss that feature ... Replaceable batteries would be nice too .,Negative
596,I dont want to have to buy a new phone in 18 months if I can buy extended batteries for 30 .,Negative
597,The AMOLED is enough reason for me .,Negative

603,The s6 active S6 active Really .,Negative
604,Im not big into phone specs and it seems that all flagship models are pretty much the same .,Negative

606,The same happened to my s7e and my battery drained halfway through the other day .,Negative
607,I did get another update a day later that apparently patched the problem since my phone is running normally now with the app installed .,Negative

636,Samsungs ssd is alright but for the price point it could be even better or little cheaper .,Negative
637,Im going to buy a 950pro soon but im waiting for a good promo currently its a bit expensive 512gb version .,Negative
638,Less succeptible to shattering the camera glass and lets it lay on flat surfaces easier without wobble Put S7 in shopping cart True no heart rate sensor and not as round as the other pictures .,Negative
639,Its because the S6 is very thin and until Samsung recently came up with a new thinner camera sensor this is all they had to work with .,Negative
641,Good news hopefully cases covers wont cause edge shadow when taking photos I went to the Best Buy and Verizon Wireless stores in my town in Ohio and they had several colors of the Note 7 at each store .,Negative
644,I honestly am reminded of my old iPhone back when they were king .,Positive
645,Ive only had one bad lag issue but that was after forcing the phone to exit the demo video .,Negative
646,The black is very nice and I hate black phones .,Positive
647,Havent seen the silver but thatll be the one I get Had a YUUUUGE lag issue after leaving the Note 7 demo video where the phone froze for a solid 5 seconds .,Negative

666,Some just choose to play with phones while theyre bored .,Negative
670,but you said it is not as loud .,Negative
671,Can you double check it .,Positive
672,Also wonder how the battery life is but I know you can not test it because it is always plugged in .,Negative
673,Unfortunately I cant set a lock up due to the demo security features .,Negative
674,I did do the iris scanner demo and it worked great .,Positive
675,Take it with a HUGE grain of salt though .,Negative
676,Im guessing you mean if Im accidentally hitting the edge like what happens with the S7E .,Positive
677,I havent done that once at all .,Positive
678,The edges are much tighter and not as prominent It requires the new USB C gearvr which hasnt shipped yet .,Negative
681,Pretty nice .,Positive
682,Better than my Note 5 for sure .,Positive
683,Very accurate and great coloring .,Positive
684,Not OP but I also played with a demo Note .,Negative
685,Its still plastic but it doesnt feel awful and cheap to me .,Negative
687,As a demo device Samsung security doesnt let me power the device off or reset .,Negative
688,Should be able to .,Positive
689,Ill test in a secondEdit Looks like our store pair of headphones are MIA .,Negative
690,Ill try to remember to bring my own to test it .,Negative
691,As far as the S Pen I feel like it got a well needed face lift .,Positive
692,Much more precise and I can see myself using it for quicker note more often .,Positive
694,I hope this is true .,Positive
695,I passed on the S 6 and Note 5 because of this .,Negative
696,Id say 128 if there was no SD card otherwise 64 a card seems reasonable Both should be a given ... I like expandable storage .,Negative
697,It makes switching phones 10x easier As someone who works for Samsung within Best Buy and gets customers like you fuck you sir .,Negative
699,I had the Note Pro 12.2 and got rid of it for a Chrome book but would definitely get rid of the Chrome book for this .,Negative
700,I used one of the first 14.3 Full HD chrome book 2s I thought chrome.os.looked like shit .,Negative
702,its windows all.over again isnt it.That said ... .,Negative
705,Samsung nailed whole curve screen thing with Note 7 .,Negative
706,They finally got a perfect balance between look and functionality Yes S6 Edge had their share of problems but you should try Note 7s curve its definitely problem free .,Positive
707,That edge was very big .,Positive
708,I brought back my S6 edge plus the day after I got it because of this .,Positive
709,Completely unusable without a case .,Negative
710,Gambled and got a S7 Edge after that .,Positive
711,It was still a bit annoying .,Negative
712,But I could use it with no case just had random letters tossed in my sentences sometimes .,Negative
714,Works amazing with no case .,Positive
715,The edge is perfect .,Positive
716,I have an S6E and and as the phone is beginning to rapidly age and get ready to go out to pasture I have to say I enjoy the edge .,Negative
717,It looks nice and I find gripping it with a case more natural than a slate phone .,Positive
718,Curve on the back flat for the screen .1 .,Negative
719,Same benefits maybe better because more ergonomic like smaller easier to handle and more comfortable .2 .,Negative
720,Less accidental touches when reaching across with your thumb or holding the phone landscape the drop down menu always seems to trigger when I watch things .,Negative
721,Its not perfect but I like it .,Positive
723,hopefully theyll pass them through fast Oh the feels Awesome means the Note 5 should see it sometime before the next round of the olympics after Brazil .,Negative
725,Hes awesome and the commercial is awesome .,Negative
727,After recently switching from iOS to Android I love stock Android MUCH more than TouchWiz or Tizen for that matter .,Negative
728,I would not get another Samsung .,Negative
730,With these and Package Disabler Pro Im actually at a sweet spot right now that Im VERY happy with my S6 except battery life .,Positive
731,REALLY cant wait for the new Note .,Negative
732,Yeah I wish I could just get android wear on my gear s but when I look into it its all forum posts of people telling people asking that its stupid because the tizen is allows features like calling but honestly the barren app store stops me from bothering to charge the watch at all at least android wear has 3rd party support ... Oh and s voice is the worst voice command platform I have ever used As nice and well built as my S7edge is the most important feature is that its an android phone .,Negative
734,But I dont like iOS or Windows phone and wouldnt buy them no matter how great the hardware is .,Negative
735,Id go Nexus or Oneplus if samsung abandoned android .,Negative
736,Im not going to a barren ecosystem run by a company that would charge huge pric,Negative
740,Why would you possibly buy Android devices if you hate Android .,Negative
741,Lol Touchwiz is not an operating system .,Negative
742,Neither is good lock .,Positive
743,They all run on Android .,Negative
746,Hopefully project ara is out by the time I need to replace my s7 Totally .,Negative
747,I have had all three iterations of the MotoX but it wont be next phone if I get another Android it will Nexus .,Negative
748,Why would you dump Android .,Negative
749,I just bought the S7 Edge and Im running as close to stock android as I can .,Negative
750,I deleted or disabled as many samsung or 3rd parties apps as I could .,Negative
751,The smart idea would to run stock android and the google launcher and dump touch wiz or wiz home whatever its called.Samsung hardware and Android software thats the key .,Negative
752,Yup I wouldnt buy a Samsung phone without Android .,Negative
753,Id probably switch to a Nexus .,Negative
754,I wouldnt care because I wouldnt be buying another device from them .,Negative
755,If they really go this way it will be a total shit show .,Negative
756,I just upgraded from the s5 to a 6p .,Negative
757,Best feature is the stock Android .,Negative
758,No more Samsung phones for me then .,Negative
760,I have so much information tied to Google at this point that switching would be a giant pain in the ass .,Negative
761,All of my 2 step verifications lay through Google my maps reviews and so much more is with Google .,Negative
762,Anyone here that says Tizen is bad because of the wearable version is really uninformed .,Negative
763,Tizen runs in so many Samsung devices and the central point of focus is usually the same advanced tech that is simple for the user and opens doors for mobile that have not been touched yet .,Negative
764,Samsung with android is nice but they havent scratched the surface with what they are capable of yet .,Positive
767,That was by far the best phone experience I have ever had .,Positive
768,Not perfect nothing is but a true joy to use on a daily basis .,Positive
770,It introduced some good improvements but took away some of the best parts of 8.0 .,Positive
771,Then I installed the preview for 10 which was a huge POS in my opinion .,Negative
773,I still lament the direction MS went with Windows Phone and what could have been .,Negative
774,I value Samsung brand name too much to not freak out .,Negative
775,I bought a sub par for price J5 against other competition simply because I didnt trust their after sales service .,Negative
776,People would eventually stop calling every Android phone a Samsung .,Negative
777,So itd be nice i wouldnt care if they did .,Positive
778,i wouldnt buy anymore phones from them but i dont care if they made the swap .,Negative
780,but i need playstore They better not.I have bought every Galaxy S starting with the S2 and I wouldnt buy a Samsung without Android on it .,Negative
782,I do love Amoled phones but I dont love them more than Android .,Positive
783,Theres not even enough room for 3 windows phone market share below 1 percent One way ticket to lose their market share .,Negative
785,It looks like HTC is finally turning things around .,Negative
786,This would be a great time to go back .,Positive
787,In a way I hope Samsung does as this should spell the end of Tizen and we can one day hope to see Samsung Android Wear watches hit the market.Edit grammar As much as I think Samsung makes good phones not really .,Positive
788,Id probably just get an HTC .,Negative
789,Thats why Google sold Motorola to Lenovo to keep Samsung happy .,Negative
790,If they were going to attempt this they should have done it years ago If this meant what it currently means for my S Gear 2 piss poor app selection laughably bad voice recognition from S Voice no Google Now or Google apps integration then off to Nexus and Android Wear I go .,Negative
791,I wouldnt buy another Samsung if they ditched Android .,Negative
792,I like Samsungs products but theyre not head and shoulders above other handsets for me .,Negative
793,Im much more investedinterested in continuing to use Android .,Negative
795,Id never consider another Samsung phone if it wasnt running Android .,Negative
796,I want Google Android more than I want samsung .,Negative
797,I love Andoid OSSoftware way more than Samsung HardwareDesign .,Positive
798,If Samsung drops Android then my next upgrade would be too the next best Android device after that .,Negative
799,I litterally cant imagine owning a cellphone tablet without the Google Play Store .,Negative
800,at first probably not .,Negative
801,but to be 100 hones if samsung does good with tizen and makes it actual competition for android or IOS then i would consider it .,Negative
803,That color is so pretty.Anyways if a reboot didnt fix it then the flex cable is probably just partially lifted .,Negative
805,When I overclocked my phone to 2.3 Ghz on core and 800 Mhz GPU this happened to me once I unlocked my phone .,Negative
806,One restart later and it worked properly .,Positive
807,In rest I didnt OC it anymore and it works properly now .,Positive
809,Yeah its pretty neat .,Positive
811,Decent for fitness tracking now makes payments almost anywhere a card reader is installed basic notifications etc. .,Negative
812,Its not life changing but it can be nice to have .,Positive
814,Im getting it for the MST payment system its as close to magic as you can get D MST wasnt available on the S2 and the addition of it on any Android phone is a huge bonus .,Positive
815,Youve just upgraded your phone to pay for stuff on just about any magnetic card reader .,Negative
816,Seems a bit crazy that their brand new product is getting a Black Friday sale .,Negative
818,I had the S2 since release these new designs and features makes me wan na upgrade .,Negative
819,Though its really up to your wrist size The S3 had some minor UI and software tweaks .,Negative
821,I have no need for the new features and the S3 is a bit too big i think Theres a beta for the iOS right now as far as the Gear Manager goes .,Negative
822,Pretty soon im sure theyll release the final product .,Negative
823,Well as far as inbox and hangouts you wont get a separate app available on tizrn you simply get notifications and can reply to them .,Negative
824,As far as google now unfortunately the tizen os forces you to use s voice .,Negative
825,Its kinda awkward anyways to talk to your watch rather than just your phone .,Negative
827,Its still a good os for the watch though very smooth .,Positive
828,Im a big screen person so Im HYPED .,Positive
829,I was hoping theyd make AN S2 with a bigger screen but this is even better .,Negative
831,Yessss Plz Tizen honestly isnt bad .,Negative
832,Been using my Gear S2 with no problem .,Negative
833,Only gripe i have is the lack of variety of apps thats it Ikr .,Negative
834,Though the pricing im concerned about since it looks rugged and has sporty features .,Positive
835,I hope its not as expensive as the Garmin Fenix 3 which is around 500 or hopefully it doesnt get as expensive as 400 Im relieved .,Negative
836,I already spent 880 because there was a phone that was slightly better than mine .,Negative
837,I didnt want to pony another 350 for a watch .,Negative
838,My beloved S2 is safe looking all svelte on my wrist .,Negative
840,LOVE the IR blaster on the note 4 they better include it in the 7 .,Negative
841,Its a flat screen variant .,Negative
842,Lots of people including myself dont want an edge version .,Negative
843,Pure marketing and probably a good idea .,Positive
845,The iPhone 7 is likely around the corner .,Negative
846,They dont want an uninformed consumer to think that the Note 6 means previous generation .,Negative
847,Hello beautiful .,Positive
849,Agree While I love my Note 2 especially with the Note 4 based Eclipse v8 rom I really looking forward to upgrading to the Note 7 or S7 edge even though Im not sure I the edge variant actually makes sense for me .,Negative
851,If this is truly it bye bye my note 4 .,Negative
852,Its really difficult to protect with a casescreen protector,Negative
855,Plus it is more likely to break than a flat screen .,Negative
856,I too am wondering this .,Negative
857,These images make me happy .,Positive
858,Holy hell I want it .,Negative

866,They knew they messed up taking it away in the first place gtThe curved side only makes me love my Note 5 even more .,Negative
868,It will make screen protectors impossible to use .,Negative
869,Just a stupid decision in my opinion.There are a significant number of people who dont use screen protectors or cases and do just fine .,Negative
870,Welp looks like Ill be leaving Samsung by the time I can upgrade from the S6 .,Negative
871,I was planning on hoping with the next note but Im not a fan of the edge display at all .,Negative
872,And judging by the way theyre going the S series is likely to not have a non edge device by the 8th generation .,Negative
874,Looks pretty cool .,Positive

876,But dat alleged 4200 mAh battery doe .,Negative
877,Will definatly be the biggest battery phone I ever had .,Positive
878,Yes you apparently slept right thru the whole rumors release and year .,Positive
879,Lol Samsung wants to get the Note and Galaxy lines on the same numbering system so GS7 and Note 7 will be the same generation of phone .,Negative
881,If there is no non edge variant Im going to be at a loss as to what to replace my 4 with .,Negative
882,Word is a new gear vr is going to be released with this phone using USB c and having updated features .,Negative
883,Having the s7 edge I wouldnt want that double edge on a bigger phone .,Positive
884,The curved portion is quite sensitive and I imagine the stretch to reach on a bigger screen will lead to more accidental inputs .,Negative
887,The only reason Im not hating Samsung after owning my Note 4 is because it has replaceable battery .,Negative
888,There is no way I trust a Samsung phone without one .,Negative
889,Ill keep the Note 4 for another year .,Positive

1016,Excellent pre review Yes and now of the much cheaper new phones are coming up with 6 GB ram .,Negative
1017,But Samsung is starting to pull a Apple to some extent .,Positive
1018,The Samsung of old refused to be out speced The new Samsung S6 onwards seems to focus on UX and refining of hardware and software.Samsung still has very good specs but they dont seem to throw in stuff just for the specs it seems.The old Samsung would have produced a Note 7 that had 4000 4500 mah battery snapdragon 821 20 mp camera 6 GB Ram etc but with horrible UI that lags ugly looking hardware etc. .,Negative

1037,all phones since beginning of year have that CPU and some phones from smaller companies are already announced with Snapdragon 821Higher clockrate and latest version to be released in August ... So except if I got this wrong and that its indeed the snapdragon 821 or that theres a way here in Canada to get the Exynos version I think Imma just wait and grab the next Nexus instead ... What are your thoughts on this .,Negative
1039,I was able to use a demo note at verizon for about a half hour the other day and am sold for that reason .,Negative

1065,One with 4 and 3500 and s7e stuff and one with 6 4000 and really powerful specs so like one could be for power users and one could be for productivity because they just want the s pen I currently have the S7 Edge and that pen on the Note 7 makes me wet man .,Positive
1066,I guess Ill skip the note 7 .,Negative
1067,Best Buy has not seen them .,Positive
1070,People that are looking at this as just a phone miss the point of the Note series entirely .,Negative

1252,Uninstalled all Gear VR related apps Oculus and Samsung VR related apps and phone is back to normal.But man that created some annoyance for the day ... Pretty sure it had nothing to do with which carrier version you have it seems to be that app update related .,Negative
1254,So totally weird but Samsung recently pushed some updates and now my phone is acting super sluggish apps are not running properly .,Negative

1274,The pop up chat head on messenger isnt working properly and my texts arent sending correctly i use the VZW message app Im on tmobile I think Google fubared something .,Negative
1275,If you try and uninstall apps or install new ones they will get stuck in downloading or uninstalling.I tried clearing the downloader and play store data but lost my list of apps ths eye recently intakes .,Negative
1276,Anyone have a list of apps recently updated from the play store .,Negative
1278,You dont make any sense the one good thing about the exploding batteries is that samsung is gon na have to wow everyone with their next iterations of their flagships to get people back on board and forget about the mishap .,Negative
1279,Just make a solid phone that does not blow up Samsung .,Positive
1281,That doesnt really matter if the VR functions are going to completely overheat the phone .,Negative
1283,Plug phone into Chromebook and play it .,Positive
1284,Only question I have is where is the curved back .,Negative
1285,A flat version would be awsome but it should still have the curved back I really do hope this isnt a prototype but What about those light reflections near the home button next to the capacitive Android buttons .,Negative
1287,There is no flat version mate .,Negative
1288,Im sorry \ Theyve already filed with the FCC and released the preliminary specs to retailers ahead of launch so they can get cases and accessories ready in time.Maybe grab the note 5 instead Damn i saw demo of it on a samsung store I hope i had the money to buy it now .,Negative
1290,i am using s6 and its battery sucks big time Best display and best camera right now Holding out for a rumored phone will leave you waiting forever They probably order the ad to be up on the launch day and the billboard company made sure it was there on time by putting it up the evening before or so .,Positive
1296,Then the TSA could seize it at a port of entry ... So you know .,Negative
1297,I would call it the Ford Pinto of phones My theory with the note 7 and apple 7 is that the phones have no way to cool down since theyre so air tight in order to be water proof ... maybe thats helping things overheat to the point that they just start to fail and poof .,Negative
1298,Man ... Anyone know when the LG v20 is coming out .,Negative
1300,Everything about the 7 is so much better than the note 4 .,Positive
1301,Im absolutely gutted .,Positive
1302,Even with two recalls Id argue the note 7 to still be the best phone released this year .,Positive
1305,In my line of work when entering oil terminals they ask to see if I have a Samsung phone regardless of what version it is .,Negative
1306,Youre better off biting the bullet and downgrading although its just an upgrade because youll actually be allowed to travel with your phone .,Negative
1308,I feel like I want to keep it until at least Spring when the new generation of phones come out .,Positive
1309,Im back on my Note 3 too and mourning the loss of my stupid sexy Note 7 .,Negative
1310,My colleague has an S7 Edge that Ive been fondling and its close enough to the Note 7 that Ill temporarily upgrade to one .,Negative
1311,After that Ill get whatever the next stylus phone is that Samsung releases later next year .,Negative
1313,Im able to return it for a 100 refund .,Positive
1314,I had the Note 2 and Note 3 for years with no issue .,Negative
1315,The only harm I have had from this is the frustration of having to return the phone twice .,Negative
1316,Im sure that in two years they will have either fixed their issues or completely imploded .,Negative
1317,Knowing Samsung as a company I will bet that they will have fixed their issues .,Positive
1318,If you dont feel confident in them to purchase a Samsung product again I completely understand but I have found that outside of this incident their quality has been unsurpassed .,Negative
1319,Then again maybe the Pixel will win me over .,Positive
1320,I also gave up my Note 7 today .,Negative
1321,I recommend the S7 Edge in an upgrade program like T mobile Jump On Demand .,Positive
1323,Now theyre laughing all the way to the bank .,Positive
1324,I could have ended up with one of these phones if they released a flat version its super lucky they insisted on the damn curved screen or Id be an owner .,Negative

1329,That table is not the table he used .,Negative
1330,T mobile Im pretty sure And its a good thing I have an extra phone that I didnt get rid of .,Positive
1331,Yeah this is the thing .,Positive
1334,Although OPs answers are pretty vague so its difficult to tell what the actual situation was if theres any chance that it was not plugged in not charging not fresh off a charge and it just randomly exploded in his hand .,Negative
1335,Then it is a much bigger more scary situation than i had been led to believe ... Any more Info or a source on that .,Negative
1336,Im not entirely sure but Id put my money on before any official statement by Samsung If you know your phone has a chance of over heating and exploding and you still want to use it before recall then common sense says dont put a case on it .,Negative
1339,Never done it but why do you have to remove the bands .,Negative
1340,Haha I get it .,Negative
1342,I really dont recommend this .,Positive

1359,I guarantee it .,Positive
1360,If its confirmed that its a stock battery its almost worse though because it shows theyre having issues with more than one model of phone .,Negative
1361,Its very likely it was a 3rd party battery though .,Negative
1363,gt Non insurance repair involves replacing the deviceAre you sure about this .,Negative
1364,My friend cracked his S7 Edge a few months back and Samsung replaced the screen on his device and gave him back the exact same phone he already had .,Negative
1365,how much was your premium.how much is your deductable .,Negative
1367,This is a new low even for Samsung customer service.What a total fiasco this company .,Negative
1369,gt When I pressed them they wouldnt give me a time frame .,Negative
1370,And you think the Note7 fiasco will be over in a few weeks .,Negative
1371,How long is reasonable for me to wait with a broken phone .,Negative
1372,Screen breakage isnt covered under warranty ... so 0 months When they repaired my S7E they indicated that the screen and bezel edge frame is one unit .,Negative
1373,Not only that but the screen is fully curved at the sides unlike any other phone that i know of which carries its own premium in labor and the manufacturing process used to make it .,Negative
1374,They must be real careless.Dropped my S6E a few times already once even from about 1.2 m above the ground.No cracks at all only minor dents around the aluminium edges thats hardly noticeable.I dont have a case or screen protector but either way you got to learn how to grip and take care of your phone.Like if I am bringing my phone along for running I make damn well sure that my pants pocket is deep and not shallow otherwise the phone can drop out of the pocket easily .,Negative
1375,S7E is gon na be about 350 400 bucks as somebody in the repair industry unless theyre using knock off non OEM parts .,Negative
1376,Also you guys should change up your procedure for Water Damaged phones I have gotten 4 people coming to me after taking it to you guys first because apparently all you do is put it in a humid controlled heat box for a given amount of time o.o exactly ... hopefully this really will be a temporary situation ... I suspect that they dont actually fix your phone they just replace it with a new one and recycle the components from the old phone into a refurbished one and maybe they are low on S7e with the Note7 mess ... I dont know ... I just cant believe theyd take this approach ... its like they want their stock to crash even further Just a note the user youre responding to wont know that youve replied because you posted a parent level comment as opposed to reply to the existing comment .,Negative

1378,Too bad theres no way to keep them from doing it .,Negative

1381,Extremely frustrating .,Negative
1382,Got my screen replaced same day at the Samsung depot in Montreal a week ago they had it for just under 3 hours .,Negative

1412,I love the Note phones my life has been much easier with the Note phones and I cant see myself with other phones than the Note .,Positive
1413,I tried I really did guys but I hate any phone without a stylus .,Negative
1415,Of course the brand is damaged its definitely not pre exploding loyalty .,Negative
1417,Im a T mobile rep and I believe it did hurt the Samsung brand a bit .,Negative
1418,Most of the time I recommend an S7 or S7E customers ask me if thats the exploding phone .,Negative
1420,As a Samsung fan it does kind of annoy me since people arent aware of how good these devices are .,Positive
1421,These reviews are just bullshitt a month ago they were like only 30 Note7 Owners would buy a samsung device again .,Negative
1422,... okay .,Positive
1425,Probably 3rd party repairers .,Negative
1426,They do void warranty though.There might be damage to the front glassLCD .,Negative
1427,For them at least in Aus they require all physical damage to be paid for to re instate warranty .,Negative
1428,If Samsung Singapore is any similar to Samsung Australia in terms of warranty requirements that might be the reason for the cost .,Negative
1429,A link to how it can be done http www.sammobile.com20161121gear manager application for ios leaks online apk Ugh cant even pair it on my HTC 10 gt Unfortunately you cant .,Negative
1430,Since the app itself isnt even official im sure the final version will have that .,Negative
1431,Thank you friend as someone who has an iPhone and Android device I switch between often I may have a good replacement for my Huawei watch The app isnt on their store .,Negative
1434,Siri was dog crap for a long time .,Negative
1435,They just barely opened it up to non apple apps with ios 10 Just buy a rugged charger case .,Negative
1436,For the rest of us we like thin phones that look great .,Negative
1437,If they said we also have note capabilities with the screen so you can use our new line of pens you can use with our device .,Positive
1438,Id buy it right away .,Positive
1439,This is the best tldr I could make original .,Positive
1440,Im a botgt SEOUL Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Sunday it would launch an artificial intelligence digital assistant service for its upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone seeking to rebound from the Galaxy Note collapse and differentiate its devices.gt Samsung is counting on the Galaxy S8 to help revive smartphone momentum after the discontinuation of fire prone Galaxy Note 7s which will hit its profit by 5.4 billion over three quarters through the first quarter of 2017 .,Negative
1441,gt The company is counting on the Galaxy S8 to help revive smartphone momentum after the discontinuation of fire prone Galaxy Note 7s .,Negative
1442,Samsung did not comment on what types of services would be offered through the AI assistant that will be launched on the Galaxy S8 which is expected to go on sale early next year.Pretty much You mean the Google assistant .,Negative
1443,Its not bad but Siri is a lot better however the new Nougat one that Google made is apparently on par and much better than Siri .,Negative
1444,I use my Google all the time but there are just some things Siri does better when we used both to see .,Negative
1445,Looks like Samsung is trying to re VIV their sales .,Negative
1446,Its up now Looks like it only applies to top loading washers and thankfully mine is front loading .,Negative
1448,Thats why all we make is stereos musical instruments kitchen appliances motorcycles computer hardware televisions eyeglasses and artificial hearts .,Negative

1457,It was hosted on YouTube The Canadian ones are usually Exynos .,Negative
1458,I cant think of a recent Samsung phone in Canada that has had a Snapdragon .,Negative
1459,Its the HDR video thats impressive .,Positive
1461,This may come in use then Moving data is easy with Samsung Smart Switch yep same thing .,Negative
1463,what is mobile hdr why samsung s note 7 screen is a window into high dynamic range s future That back looks weird .,Negative
1466,They dont give the final product to testers incase they are lost or stolen Im fairly certain this is a non edge prototype rather than the final one .,Negative
1467,Especially when you have a look at the charging port on the bottom Im pretty sure a definite USB type c charger would have a USB c shaped port not micro USB with USB c behind .,Negative
1468,This suggests to me this was a test body with a USB c put behind the micro USB port .,Negative
1469,Every Note has a stylus ... Shit looks too wide like the Nexus 6 .,Negative
1470,Rather have long and thin .,Negative
1471,I think this confirms the flat model .,Negative
1472,My source told me last month that theres 2 code names for the Note 7 .,Negative
1473,I assume an edge and flat .,Negative
1474,Should be click like any other Samsung device .,Negative
1475,S7 is click and the Note 7 seems to follow its design language so ... It looks like theres a case on when you see the pic showing the bottom of the phone with the charging port .,Negative
1476,Thank goodness it isnt .,Positive
1477,Just use your old phone as your remote ... lolI still have my LG G2 on my coffee table as my universal remote ... Lasts for weeks in airplane mode .,Negative
1478,There were a ton of different cases those were just the first to show up Not a fan of the clear .,Positive
1479,I wish they made an orange one for the s7 edge .,Negative
1480,Looking through pictures and stuff the display does look like it has a sort of curve to it I have already received my Spigen Tough Armour Case for Note7 REALLY hoping theres a regular variant .,Negative
1482,Ive tried the edge versions before and theyre just terrible feeling and looking to me How lewd Where did it say the front facing camera has flash .,Negative
1483,VIA China leaks the Galaxy Note 7 s mysterious sensor holes leaks the galaxy note 7s mysterious sensor holes 01446796 Yes tell me all about your sensor holes .,Negative
1484,Im not interested in the S7 but if they do this for the Note 7 the same it will be a big push towards it despite the probably non removable battery .,Negative
1485,I was literally just coming to market for a S7 edge and this pops up will be picking one of these up for sure All they need to do now is to have a good purchase plan and protection plans and this is how smartphones should be sold .,Negative
1486,Good going Samsung .,Positive
1487,I have the non edge variant available here in the chicagoland best buys Who is better than Samsung at updates besides the Nexus phones .,Negative
1488,Keep in mind carriers like ATampT and Verizon take months and months longer .,Negative

1493,An unlocked phone that works on sprint and verizon .,Positive
1497,sucks anyways .,Negative
1498,Id rather watch nonstop ads than that .,Negative
1499,This is good to know .,Positive
1500,Its sad to see that a tech company would to allow themselves to interfere with the user experience in such an intrusive way .,Negative
1502,Smart TVs just sound like a hindrance when I can so easily replicate and surpass the experience offered by Smart TVs by simply buying a substantially cheaper high resolution non Smart TV and slapping a Chromecast on it.On a side note I find it funny that the site hosting this article employs some pretty annoying and intrusive ads as well .,Negative
1503,Yes because anyone realistically read through the 48 pages of terms and conditions and however many pages of the privacy policy on the tiny box they have on the screen .,Positive
1504,Just buy a Chromecast or Roku thank you .,Negative
1505,Nice .,Positive
1506,Are these ads subsidizing the real price or did Samsung decide to slap ads on top of a full price purchase.This is horseshit .,Negative
1509,But Id still watch the video anyway I was surprised it still worked .,Negative
1511,I have Spotify on my 2013 Samsung Smart TV Oculus app fucked up .,Negative
1512,A hotfix has been released but you have to open oculus to install it .,Negative
1513,Do that and restart your phone to be safe then check your battery drain For me it is the Samsung Gear VR app draining battery like crazy 36 in 2h .,Negative
1514,I have no idea what to do cant deactivate it and cant uninstall it You know ... Oculus did update just the other day .,Negative
1516,But 1 the drop was inside and on a wood floor phone in case landed screen down and 2 pretty sure drops like this should not affect the battery .,Negative
1517,I will try this and report back thanks .,Positive
1518,Wow .,Positive
1519,Literally just did a factory reset today because I thought I had a rogue app going on my phone .,Negative

1524,Really glad my internal sleep clock woke me up or I might have missed work .,Negative
1525,Does anyone know who we can contact to get this addressed .,Negative
1526,This is an awful issue that not a lot of people are going to understand whats going on .,Negative
1527,I actually had a problem yesterday with receiving texts hours late .,Negative
1528,Like 8 hours late but time stamped from the original time .,Negative
1529,Weird .,Negative
1530,Glad I found this .,Positive
1531,My phone has been dying within three hours and was so warm it was insane .,Negative
1532,Will try this and see if it works .,Positive
1533,Honestly had the same exact same thoughts .,Negative
1534,Was really concerned that the phone itself or the battery was having some issue and I was going to need either a new model or to change devices .,Negative
1535,Ill try to uninstall the Oculus app and see if that works .,Negative
1536,Uninstall oculus worked to fix battery drain issue .,Negative
1537,Not sure if its related but my keyboard keeps hiding while Im in the middleof typing ... anyone else having this issue .,Negative
1538,S7 edge VZW Glad I read this mine also started this a day or so ago .,Positive
1539,And I did notice an Oculus app update .,Negative
1540,I was also having weird issues with my S2 Gear Classic .,Negative
1541,Wouldnt connect but my Pebble worked fine .,Positive
1543,It seemed okay after I started charging it and I think Oculus updated itself automatically .,Negative
1544,I uninstalled it but I guess I didnt have to .,Negative
1545,Im in Idaho and went in to my local Best Buy to see about the exchange .,Negative
1546,The Best Buy rep told me that they have Note 7s in stock but are waiting for Samsung to unlock them .,Negative
1547,I was able to preorder one and will receive an email when mine is available .,Positive
1548,He said most likely it would be around the 21st of September .,Positive
1551,First one my store has done .,Positive
1553,So happy to have it back .,Positive
1555,Only for customers who already purchased Sprints online chat is useless .,Negative
1557,I contacted them through facebook .,Negative
1562,Compared with previous Galaxy Note phones in my opinion this is a straight upgrade in every aspect thats important to me.Compared with all other phones on the market there are some positive and negative comparisons but for my own personal use its the best phone currently manufactured .,Negative
1563,Just remember to disable iMessages before you switch or you might miss a bunch of messages from friends and family that theyre trying to send to you .,Negative
1564,Its supposedly annoying to fix if you do it after youve already switched .,Negative
1565,The 4 hours screen on time kinda sucks for such a big battery ... doesnt the s7 edge get like 9 hours like my ip6 s plus with its 8 12 hours sot Someone posted a reviewer getting 4.5 sot max brightness the whole time .,Negative
1567,So battery is upper level for sure .,Positive
1568,Nobody would know how the iPhone 7 would sound or if it would have better speakers because it hasnt even been announced yet .,Negative
1570,No more rumors TVs need to last longer .,Negative
1573,This is because USB C cables are reversible .,Negative
1574,EDIT The ridges are to help identify which side of the USB cable is up so that you can essentially plug in the micro USB cable into your phone without much effort .,Negative
1575,As USB C cables can go in either way the design of the ridges are no longer needed .,Negative
1576,Would look pretty weird with ridges on both sides and having it on one side would habituate people into plugging in USB C cables only one way .,Negative
1577,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag.On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you _ may _ have the USB 3 speeds.On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere .,Negative
1578,And none of those will work on the new phone.However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new.Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C.Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier .,Negative
1579,Fine by me as long as it has wireless charging .,Negative
1581,Headphones xbox one controller etc etc So I really only have one cord and that is what came in the box .,Negative
1583,Feels snappier ... This is the best tldr I could make original location data police warrants reduced by 95 .,Negative
1584,Im a botgt Police routinely request location data from phone companies but the result is determined on the basis of the nearest cell tower which typically only provides a general estimate of a phone location.gt The better Google data is the more its ads are worth a strong incentive for continuing to collect and store exact location data.gt On the basis that Google ampquotCollects and retains location data from Android enabled mobile devicesampquot police requested all the location data between the phone activation and the date of Flowersamp039 arrest.So there is no monthly cost to be part of this program.Link to said program .,Negative
1585,Bring this to the United States and I will be a customer hands down .,Positive
1588,troy a great device .,Positive
1589,I own an unlocked Note 5 n920c version running stock marshmallow and a Galaxy S7 through ATT .,Negative
1590,My Note 5 runs as good if not better than my ATT S7 edge just because my unlocked Note 5 isnt loaded with crap software that ATT has removed features from while adding stupid apps I dont want .,Negative
1591,Similar to Apple Samsung introduced the Galaxy Club upgrade program with the launch of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge .,Negative
1592,Samsung has just told a Reuters reporter that one in three S7 customers in South Korea have chosen to join the upgrade program .,Negative
1594,I dont think its a huge ripoff considering it comes with their apple care plan .,Negative
1595,If samsung brought out the same shit here in the US Id jump on it asap The 12 Mpix camera was a surprise .,Negative
1597,I just did some research yesterday there seems to be no updated news on this .,Negative
1598,I have a gear s2 as well and I want to be able to use my fancy watch and what not .,Positive
1599,This is the best tldr I could make originalhttp Samsung is sweetening the deal for early adopters with a free Gear VR offer with purchase of either S7 running February 23rd through March 18th .,Negative
1600,Samsung says that pricing for the new models should be in line with last year phones at launch so the S7 and S7 Edge wonamp039t be coming cheap.gt Samsung is facing ever stiffer competition not only from its traditional rivals like Apple and LG but also from lower cost Chinese manufacturers that have eaten away at the low end of .,Negative

1606,Watch 59g 2.1 ozMetal Band 77g 2.7 ozWatch Band 136g 4.8 oz I like the size.Edit from the pics Ive seen that is Damn thats nice .,Negative
1607,They are slowly winning me over to buying one .,Positive
1608,Im holding out til the Note 8 because lets be honest every other phone looks like a major disappointment except the s7 .,Negative
1609,The only reason I wouldnt buy it is because I doubt ill ever use a screen size greater than 5.5 apart from that what happened to the Note 7 was very unfortunate and could have happened to any company .,Negative
1610,According to the following there is nothing to say that the Note 8 wont be coming I think someone found out that the anode and cathode within the battery would somehow short out creating heat and then causing the explosion .,Negative
1611,Note will never be the same after the Note7 fiasco.My prediction is the Note8 will do so bad that Samsung will drop the Note name for the next phone.Note exploding phones at this point Posting from my Note 3 which I had to resuscitate after returning my Note 7 finally yesterday .,Negative
1612,It took the FAA ban to force me to return my beloved N7 .,Positive
1613,Ill wait for the N8 and in the meantime getting a LG V20 deleted Im hoping theyll come back with something worthy of the note title .,Negative
1616,See this tweetfrom TMo CEO Safe to assume others will follow it begins rimshot This would be huge for tizen .,Negative
1617,It will tell you when your battery will explode .,Positive
1618,Google is not going to share the Google Assistant with Samsung .,Negative
1619,It will only be available on Google branded phones Maybe theyll kill the retarded Samsung voice assistant .,Negative
1620,The thing is just pathetic and fails to interpret the right words most of the time .,Negative

1628,not all bad news ... chin up s Just keep exchanging it for a new phone and getting the freebie promotions .,Negative
1630,At this point I hope they do no one will allow you to return or exchange your device if you accepted a replacement .,Positive
1631,A recall is the only way to recover my losses on this phone .,Negative
1632,I will say it again a flagship phone that cant be used on a plane is no true flagship and is not what I paid for .,Negative
1633,Not as sick as Samsung executives .,Negative
1634,I am also upset by it because I have a replacement Note 7 replacements cant be returned or exchanged and now I am most likely never going to be able to use it on a plane the resale value will be shot and it may start on fire .,Negative
1635,I am now stuck with this .,Negative
1637,I guess the phone is too good to be unexplody I expect the government to be all over this because they certified that the new devices were safe if it turns out that they are unsafe they are not going to risk looking stupid again .,Negative
1638,There have been claims of all types of phones exploding over the past few years but the Note 7 has gotten a ton of flack for it .,Negative
1639,I have a hard time believing a replacement phone has blown up .,Negative
1640,Until Samsung comments Ill just pretend this is on a magazine cover by the checkout line at Walmart .,Negative
1641,There was an iPhone 7 that exploded .,Negative
1645,If no other Note 7 explodes it may be someone purposely caused the explosion .,Negative

1663,Samsung and Slacker just couldnt keep up with the competition to keep milk music going .,Positive
1664,looked cool but was a C.F. Search on the net for official Samsung Galaxy Note 7 promo videos there are plenty of them .,Negative
1666,The first line of the article literally mentions that this is directly related to Brexit .,Negative
1667,Itll be interesting to see what happens when the UK government starts giving companies special deals unhindered by EU restrictions .,Positive
1668,I do not support this decision .,Negative
1669,I doubt they will release an edge variant without the normal flat version .,Negative
1670,Their edge models havent been as popular and it would be foreseeable mistake .,Negative
1671,TBH before I bought my Note 5 I was deciding really hard whether to get it or the s6e .,Negative
1672,one with the legendary spen and spen benefits or one with the sexy dual curves for looks and display effect .,Positive
1674,My understanding is they kinda have to they developed a certain chip with 3gb and improved it the easiest improvement was just doubling shit or something like thatHonestly 6gb would be nice at least theres little chance of memory issues .,Positive
1675,yes so the note series and S series can be on the same number Disappointing we will likely not have an option between edges or not but I guess its silly to make t,Negative
1678,Its hibting that this time there wont be a normal version and just a edge version Well that blows Im not one for curved screens at all .,Negative
1679,Cant wait for it ... Wonder what colours it will come in .,Positive

1713,Btw did you murder the guy who knocked out your phone .,Negative
1714,lol Thats what I wan na hear .,Negative
1716,When I detached the phone from the mount I could write everywhere .,Negative
1719,During my search I found someone that said they had to get the phone replaced .,Negative
1721,It was disconcerting to see the pen not work over the magnetized area.It would be nice to know for sure .,Negative
1722,The magnet mount I was using was nice .,Negative
1723,It does it with the Note 5 as well .,Positive
1724,As soon as I take my case off though its completely fine Luckily I noticed this issue the first time I stuck it to the mount so I dont know about prolonged use.The fact that the S Pen doesnt work on the magnetized area was enough for me to pull it off and be done with it .,Negative
1725,The screen works as intended now .,Positive
1727,We need answers on this ASAP .,Negative
1728,I ordered the spigen wallet one and the flip has a magnet strap to keep the lid closed .,Negative

1737,14.99 plus an upfront payment of 250 plus a random monthly amount determined by the roll of a DampD die Still no Canada ... My credit union was added but I use big bank credit cards anyway .,Negative
1738,Honestly most of the people who complain about their banks not being supported should just get a credit card from a bank that is .,Negative
1739,I dont know if there are many people who realize the advantages of using credit cards over debit cards .,Negative
1741,It can take weeks or months to get your money back if someone fraudulently uses your debit card but one phone call reverses a fraudulent charge on a credit card .,Negative
1742,Still no regions Youre not missing much .,Negative
1743,Went around town a few days ago to try and use it so I could get the 30 gift certificate took 3 different stores until it actually worked .,Negative

1745,Bank of England ... Nm Love the slider idea on the pictures .,Negative
1747,Huge difference Galaxy S7 Ftw .,Negative
1748,Those outdoor shots are great .,Positive
1749,Its a really bit of both from what I can tell .,Positive
1750,But the f1 .7 lens really comes into play as you can see more background details as compared to the iphone shots Go to a Samsung store and get them to flash off the carrier lock .,Positive
1753,Thanks this is incredibly helpful .,Positive
1754,Now I know what the problem is which the tech support couldnt even figure out I can address it better .,Negative
1755,Try emailing as well with the receipt and the box with the imei number attached .,Positive
1757,I still have the original product box and IMEI is the same .,Negative
1758,I dont know how it works but can Samsung change IMEI number.Anyway Ill try to contact them through social media .,Negative
1759,I cant agree more how bad their customer service is thanks .,Negative
1760,The S8 will be the bomb .,Negative
1761,Itll really bring the heat But the Note 7 already have this LightUp feature .,Negative
1762,LightUp means the cameras will shoot flames in two different directions lighting up the subjects in flames They might need to have a fire sale with the S8 .,Negative
1763,Garbage Ill wait to see if the trucks delivering it light up before I consider it .,Negative
1765,The S stands for safe ish I have a similar mark on my watch from contact with metal it hasnt come off in 4 yearsSo its not material transfer While hes wearing it but its gorilla glass right .,Negative
1766,use something softer than glass to scrape it off it looks like material transfer so i should come off with a little elbow grease Pencil eraser might work and not damage the screen .,Negative
1771,There is no reason why they should abandon them except for wanton greed .,Negative
1772,Stand by the product and keep customers .,Positive
1773,These watches are not inexpensive .,Negative
1774,I would probably buy the S5 once it comes around if the features are so much better .,Negative
1775,But if they fail to update the ware on my S2 I am going to think twice .,Negative
1776,Yeah ... I want the new one No wonder theyre giving away Fit2s Where from .,Negative
1779,They have a MO questions asked return policy if its returned within 2 weeks .,Negative

1783,Thats an invitation to the press conference on the 31st usually the launch date is weeks later .,Negative
1786,Probably going to pick one up on release .,Positive
1787,And you get data stash .,Negative
1788,I always have my 20 GB data full since I always have wifi available .,Positive
1789,They also offer free roaming in both Canada and Mexico which actually came in handy for me since I just had to go to a wedding in canadaland .,Positive
1790,... this is not the norm .,Negative
1791,If youre going with the note Id preorder to get in on that 256gb memory card .,Negative
1794,Meanwhile if you sign a 2 year contract I can get 550 off on the device for agreeing to stay with the carrier for 2 years .,Negative
1795,Since the device payment plan breaks it down over 24 months anyways isnt it beneficial to buy it under a 2 year contract .,Negative
1796,I honestly dont care if I get locked down for two years .,Negative
1797,unless hidden fees applyAlso I do know that T mobile has more perks but they dont have 2 year contracts .,Negative
1798,According to my logic above wouldnt it be beneficial to stay with VZW .,Negative
1799,Also my parents are with Verizon so we can get the 4 lines for 150 deal which is actually pretty sweet .,Negative

1805,But that 4x4MIMO is also very sexy .,Positive
1807,I would do the Note in all honesty .,Negative
1808,Its still an amazing phone .,Positive
1810,I have a striking feeling they may come up with a more advanced version with how they are currently in other countries .,Positive
1811,So the wait may be worth it but you need it now .,Positive
1812,If I were you I would figure out what I want and what the most important things are in a phone you want .,Positive
1814,I feel the Note 7 will offer more especially with the extra features it has .,Positive
1815,Plus if you make a habit out of using the pen you may grow addicted to using it .,Negative
1816,I forced myself to use it after not using it for a year .,Negative
1817,That whole year I feel like I missed out on its full potential and ever since I have never gone a day without using the pen .,Negative
1818,Its incredibly useful for what I do and I dont think I could be any more efficient with an S series phone than the Notes .,Negative
1819,Especially with how much they expanded on the pen features I am excited to get the N7 .,Negative
1820,S pen is awesome in using it right now to type this message .,Positive
1821,Browsing around with the pen is tight as hell too I dont know why you are being down voted either .,Negative
1822,I also hope that this one is black like the s7 is .,Positive
1823,I own an s6 edge and youre right its more of a dark blue which doesnt bother me but I would rather have a black phone.Id REALLY hoped for a flat model but I guess I dont mind this render .,Negative
1824,It looks as though the edges are toned down compared to the S7 edge .,Negative
1825,The s pen is going to be completely useless on the edges .,Negative
1827,They basically shrunk the screen usefulness size to make it pretty .,Positive
1829,This is really frustrating ... Now to see if all three colors are available at launch .,Negative
1830,Ah man I already got the gold App Optimization isnt a bad thing .,Negative
1832,Long press the notification and block it maybe Same discussion here Should hopefully be solved with the Marshmallow update you will then be able to disable notifications but keep the feature .,Negative
1833,Most comments are wrong .,Negative
1834,I am currently on a S6 with app opt but without the notification .,Negative
1836,It DOES work .,Positive
1837,Have this on my Galaxy Tab S2 and it is one of the most annoying things about the otherwise great tablet .,Negative
1838,That and Samsungs nagging suggestion to reboot the tablet every few days to help it run smooth ... really Samsung .,Negative
1842,You cant disable the notification without disabling the feature .,Negative
1846,I actually do .,Positive
1847,Some reason it just feels faster From what I can tell this is only available on Samsung devices running Marshmallow at the moment and the Lollipop version will be release in coming months .,Negative

1875,The only way you could get your hands on a proper camera was possible if you went ahead and bought a camera yet now phones takes better pictures and better video than some budget DSLR solutions .,Negative
1877,Standard on 80 of the builds back when DDR2 was the stuff and even when DDR3 came into the play there were still many PCs having 3GB of ram and now phones started having 6 GB of ram .,Negative
1879,Our phones surpassed both graphics wise and cpu wise what we had on the market for PCs 10 years ago ... .,Positive
1881,I cant believe my phone will have more ram than my laptop did 3 years ago .,Negative

1917,Never owned a note edge so I would like to see how it worked with an s pen .,Negative
1918,I honestly dont understand why they would do it for the Note line .,Positive
1921,I dont see how having edges will add productivity especially if it makes it more difficult to navigate with the stylus .,Negative
1922,Project Valley like you promised a year ago of gtfo I enjoy the edge display .,Positive
1923,I pray this happens I want a 5.8 or 6 Note with an edge screen and stylus .,Positive

2014,If you like Android go with Pixel XLIf you like iOS go with iPhone I rock the OnePlus 3 ... the phone is fantastic .,Positive

2099,How I hate people that dont use protection .,Negative
2102,I felt sorry for it ... I would have given them my S6 in exchange for the 7 edge Marshmallow will add most if not all of the new edge features from the s7 edge which seem to add a lot more functionality Yep Im doing that all the time really frustrating .,Negative
2103,I dont use the edge features that much so yes S7 would have been better for me but still will stick with the edge because of the 3600 battery .,Positive
2104,Yes but its not too bad for me .,Negative
2105,I may get a case for it because of it .,Negative
2106,I have a normal s7 and hit icons using with one hand .,Positive
2108,lol Try the one handed mode on your phone makes the screen smaller but its pretty nice How .,Positive
2109,I have the Note Edge which is huge compared to the other edges and i dont have a problem .,Negative
2111,nvm waives pointer finger dikembe mutombo Ive had an s6 edge since it came out and Ive never had a problem with it .,Negative
2112,Im a little surprised to even hear people say they have been having a problem with it .,Negative

2114,What case have you got .,Positive
2115,I had this issue when typing on the keyboard I would consistently delete letters or add letters until someone on reddit said you can resize the keyboard to make it shorter on each side and give a palm rest on each side PROTIP Hey .,Negative
2116,I am thinking about getting the 6p or samsung 7 edge .,Negative
2117,What do you think about their battery life and sound quality through ear phones these are important parts for me .,Positive
2119,Hope the rumor about the battery is correct This is a pre production prototype .,Negative
2120,Notice the Samsung logo is missing on the front .,Negative
2122,Ok that edge looks much better with the smaller bezels damn It looks cheap to me I really hope this is just a prototype .,Negative
2123,Fuck I feel bad about buying my note 5 now Apparently if there is one it should be together in the sim slot .,Negative
2124,So dual sim or 1 sim sd card slot .,Negative
2126,Nothing concrete of course till they announce .,Negative
2127,Mentioned before in other posts but Verizon literally told me to hold off on my upgrade until March .,Negative
2128,News and Samsung confirm S7 conference Feb 21 ... Verizon says Samsung was just in their store for an important something ... Gon na say S7 available in March .,Negative
2129,It looks like the design might be taking a Note 5S6 approach where the flat side of the phone is opposite between the two.That being said I cant say the thin frame all around the phone has much appeal .,Negative
2130,I like the previous design where it stays thin on the sides and larger on the top and bottom .,Negative
2131,Gives the curved glass side a nicer look instead of the bubble.Guess well see how it looks when officially presented though The next iteration of junk will soon be upon us .,Negative
2132,Still on my Note3 nearly 2 years .,Positive
2133,I dont see what is wrong with you people .,Negative
2134,Youre gon na be waiting for a while .,Negative

2148,Very easily actually it has a push release mechanism Is there a difference between the sport and the 3g version .,Positive
2151,I wouldve liked the design to be like the huawei watch with the tizen os and the diversity of android wear .,Positive
2152,Dont let this sway your decision Ive had mine since launch wear it every day to a job unloading trucks .,Negative
2153,Zero sign of ware .,Negative
2154,Well if it is like they did with the Note 4 it wouldnt be released until after the S8 gets released and the Note 8 is announced .,Negative
2156,You want to wait another 5 months for a replacement .,Negative
2157,Its worth the wait .,Positive
2158,Mine came today and I am in Love .,Positive
2160,This is the easiest way A little fed up with my iphone been through two in the past 1.5 years at no fault of my own .,Negative
2161,I also hated being so limited as far as customizing the UI and all that after building a PC I already took a step away from apple so I figured id go all the way.So happy with the switch You will get one big shock with that Verizon version .,Negative
2162,Start with ugly Verizon logo their bloat all over can be disabled modified firmware .,Negative
2163,Its unfortunate iOS converts cant experience a good Android experience without carrier intervention .,Negative
2164,Hate Samsung for not releasing unlocked US version at launch .,Negative
2165,I ordered mine through Samsung do you know if it comes with a Sim card or if I have to go to ATampT to get a new one .,Negative
2166,Ive heard this before but would i loose air command and all that .,Negative
2167,Such a great change Id highly recommend the switch .,Positive

2171,They are so nice .,Positive
2172,I wish I could afford one .,Positive
2175,e they were announced on 22nd Feb and available for purchase on 11th March .,Negative
2177,At least Danny Glover isnt to old for that shit Thats incorrect .,Negative
2178,Ive preordered at full price and received the two free gifts The interesting thing is that Best Buy asks a shipping address for the VR .,Positive
2179,I just ordered a phone unactivated for Verizon .,Negative
2180,It really seems to me like they might deliver the VR and not require filling out the promo information receipt at the Samsung site .,Negative
2183,If you get no resolution from the seller or the device is stolen file the complaint with Paypal .,Negative
2184,The last device I sold had a reactivation lock which I turned off and made damned sure I turned it off before I let it ship .,Negative
2185,The seller should have turned this off before selling this device .,Negative
2186,Willing and able ... .,Positive
2187,if they were selling a stolen phone which happens to be what this feature is trying to reduce they wont have the credentials .,Negative
2188,Please do not ever buy a USED smart phone off eBay to save headaches next time .,Negative
2189,The monetary savings is not worth the stress and time consumed in fixing the forthcoming troubles along with the purchase .,Negative
2192,It doesnt let me it says it has to be a MD5 or .,Negative
2194,And the ROM I downloaded is a .,Negative
2198,Its haunting .,Positive
2199,I feel the same seeing it all the time while working there ... I couldnt find the wallpaper itself but I found a phone case that matches .,Positive
2200,http www.coveroo.comholidaypcoveroo samsung s6 edge thinshieldugly sweater deer I know ... Pushed back to a vague 2016 now .,Negative
2201,Not that any of my banks work with it anyways ... Also fuck Canada .,Negative
2202,Samsung Sucks because even iVerge as people call it said it was an amazing device with potential .,Positive
2203,Samsung should make a better version of it but on Android wear .,Negative
2204,Adoption rate will be way higher .,Positive
2205,Yeah I dont get this new color ... If its released during the holiday sales Ill definitely buy it .,Positive
2206,Id prefer to wait till the S8 but I need my phone for work and my S4 is finally giving out .,Negative
2207,Because the S7 has been widely regarded as an explosive device .,Negative
2208,Do some research They arent really focused on this its just a new Color .,Negative
2209,Thats it right .,Positive
2210,That doesnt take a lot of work .,Positive
2211,That would mean that they would have to redesign the logic board and change manufacturing processes while they could do this with parts they have already manufactured Hopefully this means my S7 Edge is close to replicating what I miss from my Note .,Negative
2212,Looks great so far .,Positive
2213,I hope we arent waiting for Samsung to do all their customizing before the OTA becomes available though ... ALERT THE PRESSES This just in water is wet .,Negative
2215,This too shall past .,Negative
2216,Well no shit .,Negative
2217,64gb is the new min dont have an old phone you can use while u wait for it .,Negative
2218,Maybe coral blue note 7 before everything blew up Good news I would like to have it .,Negative
2219,Im rather surprised by this colors popularity even the Verizon sales rep at the store by me said he was surprised I was looking for a black onyx Note 7 instead of coral blue .,Negative
2220,This is good timing .,Positive
2222,Daughter grabbed the last black they had so I waited .,Positive
2223,Ill wait for blue now .,Negative
2225,My ex wife used to say the same thing I desperately need 64gb .,Negative
2226,Android doesnt play nice with microSDs much nowadays .,Positive
2227,Adoptable storage isnt exactly what it should be .,Negative
2228,64 and up is needed .,Positive
2229,Okay Im for sure trading in my Note7 Iris scanner on board .,Negative
2230,Looks wonderful but ... must ... wait for S8 ... Unlocked .,Positive
2232,Basically put they want to have 4K resolution for the Tab S3 and make sure everything works properly with the recent Batterygate on the Note 7 so thats the main reason for the delay I asked one of samsungs employer he is marketing incharge in middle east about it.he said we stopped it because of less selling ... Its not been delayed because it never existed .,Negative
2233,More useless clickbait .,Negative
2235,I have the same tablet with Lollipop.If you have an LTE version mines WiFi only ask your carriers .,Negative
2236,Yea Samsung is dumping stock in other companies to raise cash for all the Note 7 mess .,Negative
2237,Not surprising that they are slowing down at the moment .,Negative
2238,Few websites do that for no reason but eh its whatever .,Negative
2239,Samsung wants to add 4K for the Tab S3 and make sure the battery doesnt overheat so the delay is for additional testing I think you answered my question thank you .,Negative
2240,I also like the note 7 but I will be opting out and getting the iphone was your process that easy really .,Negative
2241,I have a loaner s6 already if they cant give me something else I just want my refund .,Negative
2242,Thats a good question .,Positive
2243,It first says point of sale so Id assume best buy .,Negative
2244,Technically yes but the likely hood of you getting one in the store is about the same rate as getting the note 7 back .,Negative
2245,Forgot about the bonus credit thing yeah they give you credit for exchanging with another Samsung however you dont have to if youre willing to forego the credit You have a Note 7 and an S7 Edge backup.I need your job .,Negative
2246,Keeping it until Samsung sends replacement .,Positive
2247,Love this phone .,Positive
2250,Keeping mine also I havent been able to get it to heat up .,Negative
2251,I play youtube music source for 6 7 hours during work and Ive been fine .,Negative
2252,Plus trading it back in and going back to my iphone is to much of a chore .,Positive
2255,Ill wait until I can swap this one for another Note 7 if that is ever an option .,Negative
2256,Otherwise I roll the dice with my current Note 7 .,Negative
2257,Its handled well so far .,Positive
2258,Yup havent had any official notice yet here in Australia .,Negative
2259,I spoke to a couple retailers about the issue and sales are just being quarantined here I was told we dont have any of the problem units .,Negative
2260,Im actually returning mine and will be waiting for the cheaper refurbished handsets to hit the market and just re purchase it.My phone gets hot though I have mine the only time I was a little worried was when the system updated today and the phone ran a little hot .,Negative
2261,Put it under a cold rinse and its running cool now.Thats literally the only time its run hotter than warm for me .,Negative
2262,Since I got my phone at launch its ran cool to warm every single time even when I was initially downloading and running dozens of apps for the first few days.Unfortunately my local T Mobile stores cant get it restocked enough though as they only got 40 units yesterday and ran out almost immediately .,Positive
2263,I might have to wait until Monday to get it replaced .,Negative
2264,I got mine on Thursday and still have it .,Positive
2265,I know I should return it just because I really dont want my house to burn down but I dont want another phone .,Negative
2267,I think Im gon na wait until I can go into an ATampT store and pick a new one up hopefully theres no deadline or something like that .,Negative
2269,I am on Verizon and just got the text from them saying I could return it etc. .,Negative
2271,So I am waiting until someone will just replace it .,Negative
2273,Mine works like a dream and thats with wireless charging about 80 of the times that I charge it .,Positive
2274,Pretty much no temperature change They can take mine from my cold dead hand .,Negative
2275,Theyll probably charge you if you send it back with a broken screen though .,Negative
2276,This is exactly what I plan to do except I traded in my S5 so I cant even fall back on it .,Negative
2282,That number was inaccurate because the actual reported number of cases was 35 which is 0.0014 .,Negative
2283,Basically a slim af chance that youll have an exploding battery but not impossible .,Negative
2286,Also cracked the screen the day I got it .,Positive
2287,But it works like a charm and Im keeping it until the replacements arrive .,Positive
2288,Also its nice that Im getting my cracked phone replaced for free .,Negative
2290,No issues or unusual warmth when charging .,Negative
2291,Still going to exchange but not until I can exchange for another note 7 .,Negative
2292,Until then I will be a little cautious just to be safe .,Negative
2293,Only charging the phone while Im around it to keep a eye on it and not charging it overnight while sleeping .,Negative
2294,Probably not necessary but with the fast charging its not really much of a pain .,Negative
2297,for example not leaving it on the charger while unattended and not charging next to my head while I sleep .,Negative
2298,Verizon Text came out today offering 25 off an accessory .,Negative
2300,Ahhh mine also went into a boot loop .,Negative
2301,I managed to get it through a factory reset but its junk now .,Negative
2302,Luckily I still have a few months left on my old S6 Edge contract so Ill be using that until exchange .,Negative
2304,Some file explorer app I downloaded did that also Did you download a GO app at some point .,Negative
2305,Its very old CMCleanMaster get that shit OFF OF YOUR PHONE That is definitely clean master .,Positive
2309,49999 for non euros I think it just depends on your hearing I have some partial hearing loss and it makes a difference for me .,Negative
2310,Surprised the 6P lasted that long Max brightness is unfair to lcd phones particularly iPhones because they are the brightest .,Negative
2311,The S7 on manual max brightness is around 400 nits compared to the 6s with around 600 nits .,Negative
2312,Im wondering if the Gear S3 will have this bio processor .,Negative
2313,Im going to be tempted to buy this for exercisesleep tracking and just use my Gear S2 for workgoing out .,Negative
2314,This is a new processor entirely so there will likely be some difference from the predecessors .,Positive
2316,That was a big deal breaker for me on the old one .,Negative
2317,I wonder if it will be water proof This is the future Youre a redditor .,Negative
2318,I dont need a detector to know you got body fat rtitlegore Do not let a celebrity walk away with it .,Negative
2319,I feel like the big size mixed with then making the phone thicker and curved on both sides should provide an excellent feel regardless of bumped size .,Positive
2321,Where I am I can only buy the 32 GB S7 .,Negative
2322,This means with the new phone I can never get fast performance past that 32 .,Negative
2324,After that answer Ill be slightly less unexcited .,Negative
2325,Im upset i even bought the wireless pad for my note 5 its more of a pain than its worth X Post referenced from rsamsungpay by ujbus Milestone Five million Samsung Pay users processed over half a billion dollars in the first six months showing a strong adoption rate in South Korea and the U.S.Amazon reviews on smaller capacity cases say it affect Samsung pay NFC and wireless charging So you want us the consumer to place 10000 mah worth of battery next to our head when making phone calls .,Negative
2326,Ill pass on third party stuff dont want explosion next to head or in pocket and wait for Samsung to deem its safe .,Negative
2327,Its also made in china ... Reminds me of my Motorola 7500 with high capacity battery ... Check zerolemon.comThey definitely have products for the S6 Edge .,Positive
2329,Expensive but worth it .,Positive
2332,Theyre marketed as the best of both worlds .,Positive
2333,Been wearing mine at the gym with no problem .,Negative
2334,The grooves on the rubber side mean its less sweaty than my old silicone strap How you finding the watch .,Negative
2335,Ive been struggling to decide between it and the Huawei watch thought Id post my watch with one of the Hirsch performance straps .,Negative
2337,They have the exterior look and feel of leather but are waterproof and breathe well due to the vents .,Positive
2338,Means I can wear the same strap to the gym in the shower or to work .,Negative
2339,Strap is rated for swimming if anyone feels brave enough .,Negative
2340,Yo whats up everybody its your boy Flosssssss back again with another videooo This guy says its 350 but I just waited outside next to best buy and robed the first guy that came out with it lol jk of course You might want to mention the issues with Verizon devices that can be bricked with attempts to gain access to the bootloader This work on s6e .,Negative
2344,Im gon na hold on and gather more info on these new replacement phones catching fire and in the mean time Ill continue to use my note .,Negative
2345,This phone is beautiful .,Positive
2346,Just spoke to Carphone Warehouse in the UK and theyre still waiting for update from Samsung regarding our options but said the phone is being discontinued altogether .,Negative
2347,I.e there wont be any more safe replacement note 7s .,Negative
2349,youll be fine with the iPhone 6 .,Positive
2350,iOS 10 brings some new life into older devices From where did you purchase the phone itself .,Positive
2351,On the link it appears as though and I may be entirely wrong so forgive me Samsung is refunding the accessories .,Negative
2352,When I return my Note 7 to Verizon I intend on bringing the receipts for accessories that I purchased at Best Buy to see if this is indeed the case .,Negative
2353,It may not be but it makes sense for Samsung to bear the burden of refunding accessories.Edit an earlier iteration of this link mentioned accessories .,Negative
2355,What a joke what an absolute joke .,Negative
2360,This will destroy the Note series I have never seen a tech disaster like this before .,Negative
2362,Good fuck it .,Positive
2364,Its ridiculously hard to get unlocked phones in Canada so they are probably more lenient due to that Just posted My s7 edge broke on a rug over concrete from 13 .,Negative
2367,Hope their engineering department reads these posts .,Negative
2368,The note 3 uses Gorilla Glass 3 which was essentially tank like on my nexus 6 For everyone shitting on Corning its not a weakness of Gorilla Glass 5 its a weakness of Samsung insisting that they curve the glass .,Negative
2369,Bending the glass makes it SO much weaker its not designed to be curved like that and Corning are not to blame Sorry to hear that the funny thing is i got this phone after insurance paid me for my broken galaxy s7 edge I cracked my N7 on day 2 .,Negative
2370,It fell from my hammock to dirt about 2 feet and cracked the front screen .,Negative
2372,It gets dropped weekly and has no issues R I P I dreamed I had a note 7 and cracked it .,Negative
2373,I broke three Note 5s in 72 days earlier this year .,Negative
2374,The first time it would have broke if it were made of diamond the second time was a toss up but the last time was a joke .,Negative
2375,It fell half a foot .,Negative
2376,Now I never had a case so I am not removing my responsibility but I drop my Galaxy S5 all the time sometimes majestically and it didnt break before or now .,Negative
2377,I love the Note and really want to get the 7 but is this still an issue .,Positive
2378,Gorilla glas isnt mroe solid IMHO .,Positive
2379,dropped my note 4 from 1.5 m on a tile floor which completly shattered the screen .,Negative
2381,I wasnt aware of such thing They are regular film protectors i just said glass protectors as in front and rear glass .,Negative
2384,t mobile.comaccessoriessamsung note7 zagg invisibleshield dry full body.htmlthose are the ones i picked up at the store when i picked up the phone They actually say 80 chance of survival from 1.6 m high which is head height .,Negative
2386,But yeah it seems its supposed to be more shatter resistant but more scratchable Oh man you do have me beat .,Negative
2387,lols I have a line on mine this is my first high end phone I dont know what to do the crack isnt noticeable unless put above white background and can barely be seen unless you look at it from an angle I can feel the crack tho its a thin line across the screen .,Negative
2389,Should I just buy a screen protector and put it on .,Negative
2391,If you cant do without or think you want all the new s pen features I say its worth it .,Positive
2392,Otherwise if you dont need a stylus go without .,Negative
2393,Does anyone know if the note 7 will have the same cooling as the s7 and s7 edge .,Negative
2394,Im thinking about getting it but I dont want to have overheating issues like the s6 since I do plan on getting the gear vr with it .,Negative
2395,There is nothing the S7 Edge can do that the Note 7 couldnt .,Negative
2397,Its really a question of if you use S Pen or not.There just isnt enough differentiating feature and I wouldnt even say the price is that big of a difference between the 2 phones .,Negative
2398,At least in the US the official unlocked version is 779 and Note 7 is 850 which is what the US unlocked version of Note 7 will cost once it releases in couple of months.What S7 edge costs 650 .,Negative
2400,Samsung pay dont work etc.So its definitely worth 70 to 100 actual price difference .,Positive
2402,Plus it still has some features the S7 doesnt have .,Positive
2404,It was great at writing quick notes easy place to have a quick screen grab and I just always used it for a multitude of things .,Positive
2405,I didnt use it a lot early on but I spent time with it and made it a habit to use and I realized that the s pen is much more than a regular stylus .,Negative
2406,It is a proper functionality feature that has a hell lot of potential for the Note .,Positive
2408,Feel in hand is second to none for me .,Negative
2410,I wouldnt say so.More rigid build due to higher quality aluminum Gorilla Glass 5 Improved screen 50 brighter at max HDR compatibility Vastly improved UX S Pen Iris scanner a gimmick for most people USB C USB 3.1 Slightly larger screen and dimensions 100mAh smaller battery Less curved display Significantly better in hand feel Is a s pen worth 200 to you It depends on your use case .,Negative
2412,If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge .,Negative
2413,Theyre both great phones it just depends on what feel is the most important part some more features or saving money .,Positive
2415,If you want the S Pen then there are enough other small improvements to make it worth the price.However if you dont like the S Pen then I dont think those small improvements are enough to justify 100 200 by themselves .,Negative
2416,Its not an easy decidion .,Negative
2417,Nonetheless do you prefer bigger phones .,Positive
2419,Easily worth the extra 200 .,Positive
2420,Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you can not get to the finger print scanner USB 3.1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features .,Negative
2421,I would pay more for anyone of those but to add them all together is a bargain for 200 .,Negative
2424,Thats ... Fast Please work like that please work like that please work like that .,Positive
2426,Infrared Via http playfuldroid.comsamsung galaxy note 7 starred in yet another videohttp www.sammobile.com20160721leaked video shows the galaxy note 7s iris scanner in action Seems like the same or very very close to the same speed as the fingerprint scanner which is good .,Negative
2427,If it wasnt that fast it would have been a huge mistake .,Negative
2428,Im now actually pretty impressed and excited to try it out .,Positive
2429,Wow ... Thats incredibly fast .,Positive
2431,Now that this exists I sure do hope its in the note 7 .,Positive
2432,Gives me a good excuse to take lots of 4k video .,Negative
2434,Yeah its a bug that a lot of us also are facing .,Positive
2435,What I did just until it gets fixed was to put those notifications into a separate folder so itll be mostly hidden from the main notification shade .,Negative
2437,Are you running a custom rom .,Negative
2438,S6 also .,Positive
2439,2edgyformem8 LMAOWow at least they admitted they suck.Seriously though just use a POS protector till ZAGG releases their Tempered Glass ... .,Negative
2441,The halo effect was a prime reason it hasnt released yet .,Negative
2442,I think the screen protectors may come out maybe eventually but then theyll have adhesive problems like everything else .,Negative
2444,They dont even have it on their website ... And yes people still use screen protectors because my galaxy s7 glass isnt scratch proof ... no one has a screen that can prevent scratches ... Pretty sure its in the post options somewhere but to make it easier you can now just include News Rumor etc in the title itself and the post will be automatically flaired that way as well .,Negative
2445,Settings gt Applications gt Default applications What app do you use .,Negative
2447,A lot of other major reddit apps have this capability ex Slide for reddit reddit is fun etc. .,Negative
2449,To make it easier you can now just include News Rumor etc in the title itself and the post will be automatically flaired that way as well .,Negative
2450,You need to abandon the karma below 5 crap .,Negative
2452,Not only that new people cant either without a mod .,Negative
2453,How about you just approve me per antler or give me enough karma so I dont even have this happen again .,Negative
2454,I shouldnt ha e to ask for a mod to Apple all my post .,Negative
2455,I figured out how to add a flair to my name ... Im assuming adding a flair to my posts will be relatively easy Please add a flair for S7 and S7 Edge How do I post here .,Negative
2456,I want to ask about a Samsung Ultrathin series 5 AMD thats slow as foobar .,Negative
2457,I use sync for Reddit on mobile I dont see any options to add a link flair while posting is it not possible .,Negative
2459,I dont believe so please somebody correct me if I am wrong .,Negative
2460,Dont believe you need to use it per say you just need to link a card .,Negative
2461,PLEASE NOTE http www.androidpolice.com20160308verizon who are a bunch of jerks took samsung pay off the the galaxy s7 and s7 edge but you can sideload it1 I pre ordered mine from best buy and havent gotten it yet .,Negative
2463,maybe ill get it later today .,Negative
2464,No worries man thought Id just pass the information on you never know what will help peopleEnjoy your charging pad Promo ends on Thursday so best of luck .,Negative
2465,Ahh sorry to hear that man .,Negative
2466,Did you preorder the wireless charging pad.I mean you could always return the charging pad for a refund then get a new one free .,Negative
2469,msung really shit the bed on this one .,Negative
2471,Because rushing manufacturing has worked out so well for them in the past ... deleted You have any idea how big Samsung is .,Positive
2473,The Note 7 despites its possibility to explode was a great device that introduced a lot of new features to Samsungs series of mobile devices S and Note series .,Positive
2474,In remembrance of this great device I created a short film or video titled R.I.P Note 7 to say goodbye.https www.youtube.comwatch.v88ztdBs9KEM lol yeah I got downvoted to hell for finding out about the Verizon announcment over the weekend .,Negative
2476,The only real reason to trade for the S7S7e is if you already have the Gear VR .,Negative
2477,Otherwise you might as well get a newer phone .,Negative
2478,OnePlus 3 I pre ordered my Note 7 and am still using it never replaced it .,Negative
2481,Not sure what his next move is ... I know for me Im still hoping for the Note 8 .,Negative
2482,I think the only thing they can do now is taking their time and make sure whatever theyre coming up with next does not have the same faults as the Note 7 .,Negative
2483,I think loyalists will be fine waiting an extra month or some than usual if it means making sure what we buy isnt exploding on us.I still could see some dumb pranksters trying to keep Samsung looking bad in the future though ... People in the past have turned in cracked note 7s and had difficulty getting them replaced but I heard in most cases that they did take cracked phones back .,Negative
2487,V20 has no stylus and is cheaply constructed and is ugly also will likely boot loop after a month .,Negative
2488,The Pixel XL is not water resistant and has no SD card slot and has a smaller screen .,Negative
2489,Everyone that got a note now has to compromise .,Positive
2490,It sucks .,Negative
2491,The demise of the best phone on the market .,Positive
2493,RipNote7 Im trying to figure out what to do as well .,Negative
2495,Im fuckin pissed i really dont want to compromise I was able to return it If there is it will probably be rebranded .,Negative
2496,I get your mad but you are very ignorant .,Negative
2497,Comparing samsung to Islamic terrorists is retarded .,Negative
2498,Calling them any sort of terrorist shows you have no idea what that word means and are just saying crap .,Negative
2499,Yes they rushed the phone but that wasnt the issue .,Negative
2500,The issue wasnt testing the issue was that one factory fucked up the fail safes for the battery on a very small number of phones .,Negative
2501,Samsung understanding the severity of the situation issued a recall and several warnings .,Negative
2503,I dont know why some of them exploded .,Negative
2504,But samsung didnt plan on it happening .,Negative
2505,At least they did the smart thing and discontinued it .,Positive
2506,The phones image was ruined .,Negative
2507,Nothing could bring it back Yes you need to turn it in .,Negative
2508,Yours is technically a replacement device .,Positive
2509,Though it didnt replace your device it replaced the previous iteration of the device .,Negative
2512,This was ran over whit nothing on the phone working Yes it is unsafe it seems to be a defect that effects all Note 7s regardless of being original or replacement .,Negative
2514,iPhone master race Its ok .,Positive
2516,No where near as nice as the s7s though US Its one video with a questionable test .,Negative
2517,Like that proves anything .,Positive
2518,The shills are out in force today I see .,Positive
2519,Good for you guys and girls ... Get that money .,Positive
2521,Close your eyes .,Positive
2523,Just get on your knees and take that money .,Negative
2524,I used to use Handcent .,Negative
2525,Not sure why a senior told me to use it and I did .,Negative
2526,Lately I have just been too lazy to change .,Negative
2527,Before it was a bitch to enable handcent and disable to stock app .,Negative
2529,the s7e felt much nicer in the hand but ive settled on the n7 I like how the screen is rounded on the note 7 more than the edge .,Negative
2530,Now I dont want my edge and I want a note 7 .,Positive
2533,Idk why but I have an s7 edge and seeing that I hate how curved the s7 edge is around the corners .,Negative
2534,I guess my case really covers them up because I havent noticed till now .,Negative
2536,I personally think the more rounded corners of the S7 edge better fit the Samsung theme as well .,Positive
2537,Looks like the S7 has a pink tinted AMOLED How is this 5.7 inches .,Negative
2538,The note 4 vs s7 edge shows a massive difference in size .,Positive
2539,Yeah I get is a curved screen but still Its not surprising .,Negative
2540,They added a world of features to the S7 .,Positive
2541,Plus they literally announced it and released it out of no where and offered free stuff with pre order purchases .,Negative
2542,Plus a lot of carries are offering two for one deals .,Positive
2543,people always want the newer model even if they have no idea HOW its better than the previous model and even IF the consumer even needs that level of improvement in the product thats what I did .,Negative
2544,I wonder what this means for the iPhones numbers ... Im from the Ph and even on land indoors my network coverage is poor ... unless the other networks really good and hes on it then maybe ... .,Negative
2546,Its beautiful .,Positive
2547,Thats a very nice shot .,Positive
2548,This was taken with the phone camera alone Its because its an Apple subreddit not a Samsung subreddit.If Im not mistaken the downvote button is for comments that are of no substance and do not add to the conversation .,Negative
2549,Not an I disagree so fuck you button .,Negative
2550,So if you posted this as a parent comment you would be rightfully downvoted .,Negative
2551,So cry more.Now .,Negative
2552,If you were posting on a thread about cameras and you were making a point about how a certain camera is better than another then people are just butt hurt over the obvious truth.As an iPhone user probably will be for a long time just for the fact that Im picky and android has too many issues I can wholeheartedly say that Samsungs cameras nowadays are better than those of the iPhones .,Negative
2555,No way my Note 3 could focus that close .,Negative
2556,Hell sometimes not even from a distance .,Negative
2557,Thank you .,Positive
2559,I took a similar picture with selective focus which didnt turn out as nice I focused on the center of the picture frame where the water drops are hence the reason the water drops and grass near the stem have high acuity .,Negative
2560,Personally I think the perceived fuzziness contributes to the depth and overall quality of the photo .,Negative
2563,Things this picture is 1 .,Positive
2571,My coworkers s7 edge fell down from his pocket and shattered too .,Negative
2572,This gorilla glass lowered in quality .,Negative
2575,It sucks .,Negative
2576,Makes me worried on my s7 obligatory asking_the_real_questions .,Negative
2578,The wallet glue failed and the phone fell between the elevator and the floor .,Negative
2581,Delivery people are not idiots and gasp he could also know about the release of the new phone2 .,Negative
2582,He knows who shipped it and I wouldnt be surprised if they know generally what the contents are eg .,Positive
2583,Electronics phone etc. for security of package handling3 .,Negative
2584,When I opened the door I said Oh wow I was planning on staying home all day tomorrow waiting for that to which he responded with my title .,Negative
2587,The same thing happened to me i got mime yesterday at about 5 From ups .,Negative
2588,No complaints from me rthatHappened Already in freaking love with it and I am at work and not even,Negative
2590,OTE http www.androidpolice.com20160308verizon who are a bunch of jerks took samsung pay off the the galaxy s7 and s7 edge but you can sideload it1 Most Ive found out is that its launching in 2016 very soon apparently.Its going to be expanding to China Spain Brazil the U.K. Canada and Australia.http www.digitaltrends.commobilesamsung pay newsixzz42AXBqrHI No worries aha glad I helped .,Negative
2593,Ahh no ... Only one day out.You never know what promos are next hang in there .,Negative
2594,It says you can get a free 30 gift card .,Negative

2596,XD It does include a notification icon on the watch face .,Negative
2598,What new apps are available .,Positive
2599,HAHA I was not trying to imply the fix would take ten minutes just a faster video .,Negative
2600,I linked the original in the description below the video .,Negative
2601,28 min ... no need for a heat gun unless you want to get of the display from the bracket .96 ethyl does the job better and faster .,Negative
2602,the back glass is super sturdy when it comes to twisting it if it isnt damaged already.using the plectrum to get the metal frame off is not needed you can easily press it out.taking the battery out is easy with 96 ethyl again .,Negative
2603,no need to losen the screw on the usb pcb until the very end .,Negative
2605,I wanted the s6 edge but got the Note 5 because I promised myself that a Note would be my next phone .,Negative
2606,No need for whos going to get the future note.I got the Galaxy S6 and as many others the s pen feature doesnt work unless its going to be something gimmicky.However in the future Ill get the Note 6 no doubts .,Negative
2607,Had the note 3 amazing phone missing the Note features .,Negative
2608,But writing with that edge would be a disaster .,Negative
2609,No thats the 100 Google Play card if you trade in your iphone for a Galaxy .,Negative
2612,It probably is ... Im not sure why I only got 1 email for this stuff .,Negative
2613,Nothing after .,Negative

2626,Still no update on my promotions ... If it comes to that I may have to .,Negative
2627,Thanks for the thought .,Positive
2629,Good idea Ill check .,Positive
2630,Something semi similar happened to me got fucked over by samsung support never buying another samsung product .,Negative
2631,Thats how they keep fucking you if you just let them .,Positive
2632,No need do go to negative right away .,Negative
2633,SamsungSupport on twitter has always been pretty responsive in my experience .,Negative
2634,Im sorry that you had this experience with T Mobile .,Negative
2635,With rates that cheap they have to cut corners somewhere right .,Negative
2636,It used to be that youd be stuck with a terrible network with them now that thats improved I guess its customer service and lack of uniformity in corporate store policies .,Negative
2637,T Mobile locations are absolute shit .,Negative
2638,The T Mobile phone supervisors are the absolute best .,Positive
2639,If you ever have a huge problem like this speak directly to a supervisor and explain what theyre doing wrong .,Negative
2640,Ive had a supervisor give us a 200 credit in the past .,Positive
2641,You ended up getting free phones somehow because the supervisors are the only ones that get stuff done .,Negative
2642,ATampT user here and I had the same experience .,Negative
2643,Literally walked into my store returned the phone and that was it ... Maybe were lucky .,Negative
2644,I dont know but that was a painless 5 minute return for me and it seems like on Reddit theres another person every day with issues of exchange or return on a worldwide recall.Granted I didnt have to do an exchange as I have a backup phone but I cant imagine its significantly more difficult .,Negative
2645,I guess the big issue here is if you can wait for the note 7 replacement or not .,Negative
2646,I personally will be fine without the note 7 for a few more weeks as Im not going to die without it which seems to be the case for most people online .,Negative
2647,Im sorry you had such a sour experience I just moved back to t mobile after a miserable time with VZW .,Negative
2648,I must have gotten lucky I tried 1 store while at work and it was clear they had no idea what they were doing .,Negative
2649,Stopped by another on my way home and it was night and day the whole process took 25 minutes because of content transferring between the note and s7 edge .,Negative
2651,Phone rep told me to go in store store people said I Was nuts .,Negative
2652,They just have a disconnect there but theyre still better than all the other carriers .,Negative
2653,I have thanks .,Positive
2657,I did go in store initially but he actually talked me out of exchanging it .,Negative
2658,Weird .,Negative
2660,Got ta be sure your dealing with a Corp owned store .,Negative
2661,My first problem was going into a t mobile independently owned store .,Negative
2662,They are the absolute worst in service and complete assholes .,Negative
2663,Ive been calling t mobile over 9 times my boyfriend has 3 times .,Negative
2664,We went to one location the shitty one then the good store .,Negative
2665,It took over 3 hours for the two stores and we were almost late for work .,Negative
2666,We now have loaner phones we had to pay taxes for and yesterday a t mobile phone support was going to call me back to order our new phones the iPhone 7 plus .,Negative
2667,Our bill is over 700 .,Negative
2668,Were stuck with free tablets because the shitty store pressured us to get them .,Negative
2669,Then after signing the papers he tells us theres a 75 restocking fee for each tablet .,Negative
2670,Loyalty dept wont take back the free tablets cause their not technically accessories but they are since you cant get them without ordering a note 7 .,Negative
2671,And our note 7s could have blow out our eyes cause the phone got fucking hot using it with a gear vr .,Negative
2674,Now Im afraid these s7 loaners are somehow gon na be our upgrades and we wont get the actual phone we want .,Negative
2675,Weve been with t mobile for 4 yrs .,Negative
2677,Im so tired of t mobile so called support .,Negative
2678,They dont do shit but placate you or like in the store you got associate yelling at another coworker on the phone .,Negative
2679,Its a shot show and its not totally t mobile fault but it is .,Negative
2680,And its also Samsung fault too .,Negative
2681,They made a battery that has created over 2 million people that have lost their shit on people just doing their job or in some cases they employees aint doing nothing to help .,Negative
2683,Yeah well this is Murica where everything is smoke and mirrors as everyone is just shaking in their boots worried they will be sued .,Negative
2684,Isnt it lovely .,Positive
2685,Not until they fix their TouchWiz RAM managment and put a decent storage with a decent speed and get rid of the UFS 2.0 garbage .,Negative
2687,Get yourself a package disabler and enjoy Wireless charging was only baked in since the S6 though .,Negative
2689,Im pretty sure you can buy cases for iPhone to get wireless charging .,Positive
2690,Lol if you need to ask the answer is no .,Negative
2692,You can already get Commuterhttp www.otterbox.comen usgalaxy note7commuter series casesam4 galaxy note 7.html Symmetryhttp www.otterbox.comen usgalaxy note7symmetry series casesam28 galaxy note 7.html and Defenderhttp www.otterbox.comen usgalaxy note7defender series casesam2 galaxy note 7.html for the Note7 .,Negative
2693,Im using the Commuter kept my Galaxy S4 saf,Negative
2695,e Ill take my chances with it again .,Negative
2696,i use tempered glass screen protectors from ebay for like 4 a piece .,Negative
2697,I go through about 4 a year and they have saved my phone more times than i can count .,Positive
2698,well worth 4 .,Positive
2703,Drop it the wrong way and it will crack .,Positive
2704,This will never change and of course there will be others with a cracked phone.Its called statistics .,Negative
2705,did you purchase it through samsung .,Positive
2709,Looks like Gorilla Glass 5 plus curved edges is a fail at this point .,Negative
2711,To prove that glass will shatter if it lands the wrong way .,Negative
2712,Mine is fine but I dont drop my phones .,Positive
2713,Not my screen but my back glass broke about 3 months after I got the phone I dropped it while I was sleeping .,Positive
2714,The phone was next to me while charging and I guess my arm got caught on the cord and the phone was pretty much just thrown onto a concrete floor .,Negative
2715,I am glad my screen is fine though .,Positive
2718,I shattered the back glass when it didnt have a case on shattered the front with a case on .,Negative
2719,Luckily its by the button and not in the middle of the screen .,Negative
2721,I feel like the only case that will protect the screen is a smart cover case .,Positive
2722,Oh man I was hoping there was a thread regarding this .,Negative
2723,I had a 5s before my note 7 and have been worryong about the screens integrity .,Negative
2724,In the 2 years I had my 5s the entire phone held up like a champ .,Negative
2725,I never once replaced the screen or phone .,Negative
2726,My concern with the note 7 was the edge style screen .,Positive
2727,Im curious about peoples experiences with Samsungs other edge style phones as well though as well as what case would potentially work best for the note 7 .,Negative
2729,Bought it on Friday smashed the upper left corner on Saturday .,Negative
2731,It doesnt interfere with functionality and a little bit of its beauty is blemished but the water resistance is done .,Negative
2732,So I will pay to get it fixed .,Negative
2733,T Mobile washes its hands of the whole thing sent me to Samsung.Edit Reason I dropped it .,Negative
2734,Had it on my lap about 18 off the pavement and that damn glass back is sooo slippery .,Negative
2735,had Galaxy s3 S5 and S7 edge .,Negative
2736,Dropped all of them multiple times most of the time without any case never had a shattered display Right .,Negative
2742,I have the same problem freaking S Pen keeps getting stuck stuck ffs Samsung Thank you for the heads up .,Negative
2744,This situation happened to me too .,Negative
2745,Hella pissed as I just got the phone .,Negative
2748,We have a new SPengate coming Im going to try to pick one up tomorrow thanks for the heads up .,Negative
2749,Note 5 suffers from it too .,Negative
2750,Mine is like that i have to flick it to open sadly my carrier was unable to help me as they had no phones in stock ill be going to my nearest Samsung service center next week .,Negative
2752,I originally had a 2014 Moto X but the screen cracked .,Negative
2753,They sent me an S5 as they had no Moto Xs in stock .,Negative
2754,A couple months later Im at work using my phone and put it down to take a call on the landline .,Negative
2756,After the call I picked my S5 back up but the screen wouldnt turn on .,Negative
2758,Battery restart etc and nothing was working but the phone would still vibrate that indicates it was accepting input .,Negative
2759,Called up Asurion and told them their replacement device they sent me stopped working for absolutely no reason and they having no S5 or Moto Xs in stock sent me a nice new gold S6 .,Negative
2760,A couple of years ago it felt like Id be on the phone with Asurion for 2 hours but recently it seems like a 20 minute call at most is all I need to make .,Negative
2761,All I had to do to submit my claim is go to their website sppmobileclaims.com and submit a claim using the phone number that I gave them when I bought protection plus .,Negative
2762,They called me next day to confirm what I said on the claim .,Negative
2763,The second claim went really wrong though because they sent me a letter saying they never received my old device so they were going to charge me 400 .,Negative
2764,I called them at the official number they have on their website and the rep. Just said I have to call USPS and give them the tracking number and say it was never delivered and USPS will give me a claim number and to just give that to an spp rep. and I wouldnt have to pay anything .,Negative
2765,They connect you to an actual person when you call the number really quickly and they are good at what they do Id rate them up there with Amazons customer service .,Positive
2766,Im thinking you were calling the wrong number and were talking to insurance for T Mobile or any other cellular provider that also deals with them and not Samsung protection plus which use the same insurance company .,Negative
2767,This is their correct number you call it or visit the website I mentioned earlier only those will put you in direct contact with their spp department and not their other departments .,Negative
2769,Because I would love this I wonder if the screen is still as easy to break .,Positive
2770,Bought one today came from an S6 .,Positive
2771,Its awesome I love the color green but not on this phone Why the heck arent these in Australia .,Positive
2773,Yeah but the active series never sell as well as the regular .,Negative
2777,We get it .,Negative
2781,Bluetooth will sync and connect with almost anything but you need to root and maybe do a few other installs and such to make it work .,Positive
2783,thanks .,Positive
2784,Your submission has been removed from rsamsung because your comment karma is below 5 this is in place to prevent spam.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically .,Negative
2785,SARCASM Sad to see Ars Technica going full retard on their headlines .,Negative
2786,I left Samsung after the S2 a few years ago for an LG up until now .,Negative
2788,I absolutely hated Touchwiz but these phones and the UI are fucking phenomenal .,Positive
2789,As soon as I found out there would be manual video controls I was completely persuaded to come back instead of looking to the G5 .,Negative
2790,Just my preference as a bit of a cameraphile .,Positive
2791,I hope that the reviews hold up and that the phone has decent longevity .,Positive
2793,I bought an S6 bought into all the hype ... GIVE ME BACK MY IPHONE .,Negative
2795,Sweet if so I would definitely upgrade to the Note 6 from my Note 4 I want to see some other innovative features in the note line up My pen doubles as a stand too .,Negative
2796,Yea thats happened a couple times for me .,Negative
2797,But there were also times when it really didnt work I was bummed.Ive found the registers where they use this contraption doesnt seem to work with SPay .,Negative
2798,Not sure but it must be the way the signal is transmitted .,Negative
2800,Whoops Go my S3 today well chuffed We already sell pink gold Not mines Unfortunately no Ive observed the same from last year Any news on when Verizon will get the blue .,Negative
2801,Downloaded the files from someone on XDA.Flashed with Odin and fully working .,Negative
2802,Screenshots of everything please Dial 06 and youll get a serial number QR .,Positive
2804,You only get 3 tries to get it right .,Negative
2805,I upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the S7 Edge and love it .,Positive
2806,I definitely couldnt wait for the S8 and was well due for an upgrade .,Positive
2807,still arguably one of the best Andr,Positive
2809,oid phones out there along with the 6P Note 7 and maybe the Moto Z .,Negative
2810,What it comes down to is if you want the phone now or in six months time ish .,Negative
2811,The S7 is a top phone .,Positive
2812,Waiting for S8 If thats the only two phones you are looking at then S7 for sure.You wont see a massive difference in performance since there is no 10nm yet.But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October.Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7.I suggest this because Google phones are updated and most secure android phones you will ever find .,Negative
2813,I am in the same predicament .,Negative
2814,I was gon na go with the note 7 I always wait for the storm to ride out as I call it the beta test and thankfully so .,Negative
2815,Since its big recall I am too scared to mess with it anymore .,Negative
2816,So Im waiting for the S8 edge .,Negative
2817,its just about 5 6 months away look at it as 137 days away ... .,Negative
2818,Not to be a dick but why would it increase the life of his phone .,Negative
2822,The s8 is reportedly going to be out Q1 or Q2 2017 depends if you can wait that long .,Negative
2823,The s8 will be better than the s7 but the s7 is still a top notch phone I think really at this point the S7 has everything you need .,Positive
2825,But wireless charging water resistant great camera great screen its really the whole package .,Positive
2826,Only thing lacking if you could even call it lacking USB C .,Negative
2828,The s8 will obviously be better and even if you dont like it you can get an s7 for cheaper by then I am with U.S. Cellular they are the only coverage in my rural area and they have a pretty limited phone selection .,Negative
2832,High quality phone for sure .,Positive
2833,The screen is glorious ... gorilla glass too I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7 having to return it under the recall .,Negative
2834,I really never got used to the edge thing and battery life was not near even my 2 year old 6 but it was OK .,Negative
2835,I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time .,Negative
2836,Battery life is also kinda short depending on what the phone is doing but it feels like less than the 6 most of the time .,Negative
2837,I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation .,Negative
2838,I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair.Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones .,Negative
2839,Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor .,Negative
2841,Its bigger than the non plusses and large enough that I can still fat finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it .,Negative
2842,If you can overlook the neon glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing Ive seen especially at night when the black screen background is ... black .,Positive
2843,And being able to get content on and off of it without iTunes cancer is miraculous in and of itself .,Positive
2844,Chrome on Android kills Safari even on IOS 10 IMO .,Negative
2845,I dont think youd be missing anything going to the S7 if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem .,Negative
2846,As long as it doesnt explode or shatter.Also ... compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster ... most of the time there is no waiting for things to load but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device .,Negative
2847,I am in the same bloody boat .,Negative
2848,Currently using Note5 wanted to get a Note7 when it came out but then the phones were recalled and whole exploding battery fiasco thing kind of scared me .,Negative
2849,Decided to go for an iPhone7 but seeing the reviews and even the speed tests I am not sure it is worth the money and I am back to block 1 .,Negative
2850,Should I get the Note7 when it launches with safe batteries get an S7 Edge or wait for an S8 .,Negative
2851,So fucking torn between these three choices If only it wasnt ATampT exclusive .,Negative
2852,Id consider it if there was an unlocked International version .,Negative
2854,So worth it .,Positive
2857,Oh man im also torn at the moment .,Negative
2858,Im using an iPhone 6 right now and have been doing since it was released and im happy with the phone but im kind of tired with Apple locking everything down .,Negative
2859,iPhone 7 is just Apple helping me with the decision to switch over .,Negative
2862,I recently came from an iPhone 6 to an S7 Edge .,Negative
2863,It is an amazing phone and Im not worried about newer phones like the S8 coming out .,Positive
2864,This is because there isnt really anything that this phone is missing .,Negative
2865,It has a bloody massive battery great screen micro SD card support IP68 water resistance etc. .,Negative
2866,The S8 will most likely have the new iris scanner but honestly a finger print scanner is more practical and probably faster .,Negative
2867,What Im saying is that the S7 difference from an S8 wont be that big especially when you previously used an iPhone .,Negative
2869,I was told Id get mine carphone warehouse too 2nd October .,Negative
2871,Not giving up my phone unless there is like a super ridiculous time frame like January 2017 .,Negative
2872,Especially not going to iPhone again because I just got done transferring everything over it seems like .,Negative
2873,Hopefully the early October like they said is the later date .,Negative
2874,I prefer USB C. Coming from iPhone I cant imagine having to actually look and see which way the cord goes in each time .,Positive
2876,Not to mention the 64gb internal which is important for us folks who keep all our porn in Secure Folder which doesnt allow storing on the SD card .,Negative
2877,Also the screen is brighter AND dimmer .,Negative
2879,I had a Note 4 which was a great phone .,Positive
2881,Its resetting itself and freezing and now is stuck in a constant reboot loop .,Negative
2882,I argued with Sprint for 4 DAYS over them getting me out of my contract and selling me the phone with their new contract price because I didnt want to spend 850 on it .,Negative
2883,I finally got them to agree to drop my contract and start a new one so I can get the phone .,Positive
2886,Never even shipped it to me .,Negative
2887,Now my Note 4 is 100 dead and Im using my wifes old S5 .,Negative
2889,Samsung pinpointed the issue and resolved it a good while ago now .,Positive
2890,And replacement units were shipped out to stores .,Negative
2892,Rather than waiting even longer for that Samsung consulted with the Consumer Product Safety Commission .,Negative
2893,Now youre all waiting for word from the CPSC before the phones can actually be released.The original timetable had exchange units in stores by today or Friday .,Negative
2895,I stopped by best buy today jus,Positive

2904,I went from Samsung keyboard to Swiftkey ... now I use Google keyboard .,Negative
2905,You can type a word then select it in the recommendation bar up top to add it to memory.Alas I can cuss all day long without spell check .,Negative
2906,When comparing with the iPhone 5 keyboard and autocorrect which I owned and used for around a year before I purchased a Samsung S6 Edge have now had for a year also I found the autocorrect for the iPhone was far nicer .,Negative
2907,At first I put it down to just getting used to the new phones nuances but since then Ive realised I did just find typing a text less cumbersome on the iPhone .,Negative
2908,I frequently have to delete the autocorrection because the phone didnt recognise the word refill out the edited part then hit space only to have it autocorrect again .,Negative
2909,I dont know exactly why but this I think has been one of the bigger issues Ive had with switching that just hasnt settled in every other difference is now just normal and I struggle to remember how to navigate an iPhone .,Negative
2910,Not sure why youd want to drop so far down in performance but to each their own I suppose .,Negative
2911,My Note 4 was great and aged amazing .,Positive
2912,The only drawback was battery it would reach a certain point and then jump to very low numbers .,Negative
2913,Like it would go to 20 or 24 and drop to either 0 or 8 .,Negative
2914,Could be the battery or I could have damaged something with leaving it someplace hot because that seems to be the case with battery issues Ive seen .,Negative
2915,This ... I had iPhone4 then sgs3 now sgs5 and thinking of what to switch to next .,Negative
2916,I miss the smoothness of iPhone but keep remembering that end of 2 years of iPhone4 when I was so tired of the phone .,Negative
2917,With my sgs5 I can throw on a new launcher or get rid of all my old widgets and install new ones to tide me over till more options come out .,Negative
2918,I see the whole IOS is optimized for the hardware argument being thrown around a lot .,Negative
2919,I left IOS because the updates slowed my iPhone down to the point where it was almost unusable .,Negative
2921,The phone has gotten faster with updates particularly MM .,Negative

2926,Awesome battery life .,Positive
2927,An amazing camera .,Positive
2929,Premium build quality .,Positive
2932,Samsung pay works in more places.Anything prior to the Note 4 is going to give a less than stellar representation of the Samsung experience as prior to that It honestly was a bad experience .,Negative
2933,Samsung have taken their game to the next level with their recent phones especially the S7 series .,Negative
2934,At the end of the day it will come down to your preferences stylus iris scanner and stuff like that are all great.Where as iPhone has the iOS eco system etc. .,Negative
2936,Force touch .,Positive
2937,I am amazed about how the headphone jack wont make you buy the iphone 7 .,Negative
2938,You still didnt see what apple has to say about this .,Positive
2939,it might be because the phone became waterproof so the headphone jack could be replaced with different earphones .,Negative
2940,Dont be so negative before the iphone 7s release Having owned Samsungs since the first galaxy I can tell you that Ive only had issues with one and that was the s3 and that was my fault .,Negative

2958,Though it seems the IR blaster days are over Im in the same boat its gimmicky .,Negative
2959,From what Ive seen the type of cases I prefer to use on my phoneslow profileslim i might as well not even use it because so much of the edge is unprotected .,Negative
2962,But look at the lack of screen protection Samsung Galaxy Note7 Otterbox Symmerty Case Youll only be missing out on an Iris Scanner and 64GB Base Storage .,Negative
2963,If you dont need the S Pen I think the edge has got you covered .,Positive
2965,I will probably sell this if this is the case and go iPhone Nexus or Note 7 .,Negative
2966,Part of the reason why I bought this was because I assumed itd get updates without carrier interference but I could be mistaken .,Negative
2967,Time will tell but as of right now Im still happy with it .,Positive
2970,Terrible .,Negative
2971,gt Im very sorry for any confusion .,Negative
2972,Our unlocked devices do not receive updates .,Negative
2973,This is because carriers Becca is in need of some retraining because clearly Samsungs other unlocked international non branded devices can and do receive updates both full releases and security updates so yeah .,Negative
2975,just ignore Becca .,Negative
2976,I took it to the Samsung repair centre and they would have fixed it if my warranty was still valid but there was a little crack in the back so they quoted me for it.I ended up getting a wireless charger and that does work so if you can try a wireless charger to check it that might work for you I went into a phone store that had some lying out .,Negative
2977,I tried a few older cables and USBs but none were working I just had it in a Samsung Repair centre and none of theirs did either .,Negative
2978,Ive ended up just ordering a wireless charger for now Samsung wanted almost to fix it .,Negative

2999,Completely frustrating experience I gave up.So if that article is right which I really hope its not that would be really bad NO QUALITY APPS but the Samsung ones .,Negative
3000,More like this isnt good for anyone .,Negative
3001,Not great for Android because thatd mean a huge piece of the market share goes bye bye terrible for Samsung because people WANT Android even if that means they get TouchWiz with all the bloat Samsung can give and certainly not awesome for us either Nexus 6p .,Negative
3002,Honestly nexus is the only legitimate game in town when it comes to android .,Negative
3003,Mobile suicide Yeah unless it ran android apps and more efficant .,Negative

3016,It takes quite a few tries for them to get it right .,Positive
3017,The Edge on the earlier Note didnt make much sense until they brought it to both sides .,Positive

3046,This is fantastic news .,Positive
3048,Works like a charm and by far the best phone Ive ever used minus the Note 7 which I have used for few weeks before having to return it .,Positive
3049,Ive tried several other Android phones and never found anything better than Samsung .,Negative
3050,One advice I would give would be to keep the device memory usage below 80 Keep your 6P for another 5 months .,Negative
3051,Youll probably regret getting the S7 later on .,Negative
3052,Samsung wont even fix the phone now if you break the screen ... Id stay away until they get all their problems under control Thanks for all of your input I will probably still wait then .,Negative
3053,Id suggest waiting for the new coral blue to come out and snag it then .,Negative
3054,I just ordered the S7 flat because I found a good deal .,Negative
3055,Otherwise I would not be paying 700 right now with the S8 releasing in march .,Negative
3056,wait s8 it will be a gamechanger even for mobile VR 4k .,Negative
3058,If you can get a good deal on the S7 500 range then go for it.Otherwise I would take the next few months to save up for the S8 which is probably going to be 800 dollars .,Negative
3059,I have the S6 Edge and was going to upgrade to the S7 but its better to just save the few hundred dollars for the upcoming S8 .,Negative
3060,Got my S7 Edge nearly 2 weeks ago and I absolutely love it .,Positive
3061,Its an amazing phone .,Positive
3062,If my carrier offers an upgrade program then I sure will but if not I dont see myself being too fussed about it .,Negative
3065,If I were you I would wait a couple months for the S8 because Im sure that will be a good phone but I do have a Galaxy S7 and the only thing I dont like about it is that its not the Edge .,Negative
3067,Just search Galaxy tab and there will be a plethora Highly doubt Apple will be doing any such thing .,Negative
3069,More iMessage users .,Negative
3070,At this point I recommend waiting for the S8 .,Positive
3071,Its right around the corner .,Positive
3073,jesus christ I work for a samsung authorized service center and wed get absolutely reamed by Samsung if we ever did that to a customer.If you kick up a fuss you should be able to get an exchange .,Negative
3074,Samsung is crap in software The problem is at least in some cases you really dont know how crappy a companys customer service is until you need service on a product youve already bought and paid for .,Negative
3075,that sucks .,Negative
3077,After calling again almost every day and contacting Twitter support they still have not called me .,Negative
3078,Twitter support told me that they couldnt help me and my situation was being handled by a special team who apparently dont know how to use a phone.Support on Twitter told me to call and ask for their specialized team to which I did .,Negative
3079,The response from the phone rep was that she did not know what they were referring to and that they do not have a specialized team .,Negative
3080,Does anyone know of a Government consumer protection group I can file a complaint with .,Negative
3082,I cant wait on this any longer I dont care that you have a recall going on .,Negative

3092,Im also on Verizon Yep I updated my phone like three days ago .,Negative
3093,And for what its worth im on atampt as well I have the Verizon Galaxy s6 edge and I am having trouble uninstalling the gear vr service app .,Negative
3094,I see it on my list of apps but the disable button is grayed out .,Negative
3095,The only option I have is to force stop .,Negative
3098,Are you charging over night with the fast charger .,Negative
3099,That could be a large part of your problem right there .,Negative
3102,ically stop charging at 100 especially if they are fast charging .,Negative
3103,You may have overcharged your battery .,Negative
3104,Ive also just started experience an extreme battery drain on my Galaxy S6 Edge today .,Negative
3105,Really not sure what the issue is .,Negative
3106,Battery seems to be reporting a heavy use of Google Services but Im curious if it has anything to do with the recent update that came out a few days ago .,Negative
3109,It usually lasts through the workday at about 60 but its nowhere near that today .,Negative
3110,Its also noticeably more hot to the touch today .,Negative
3111,Battery seems to be in overdrive for whatever reason .,Negative
3113,its the gear vr app Fixed the battery issue but keyboard is still constantly collapsing while Im typing .,Negative
3115,Kinda glad I stuck with the S6 for now.If youre experiencing overheating even when not using or charging your phone it could be down to a particular app .,Negative
3116,Luckily the Battery optimiser setting allows you to stop apps from sapping energy when the phone isnt in use .,Negative
3117,Go to Settings gt Battery gt Battery Usage gt More gt Optimise battery usage and tap All Apps .,Negative
3118,Doing this will stop apps from working in the background even when youre not using the phone.If overheating persists you can try wiping the cache partition .,Negative
3119,With your Galaxy S7 turned off press and hold the Power Home and Volume Up buttons together until you see the Samsung logo and then release .,Positive
3121,Tap the Volume Down button to scroll down the list of options and then select Cache Partition by pressing the Power button.If all else fails a factory reset might be in order .,Negative
3122,If that proves unsuccessful its time to return the S7 to Samsung for a replacement .,Negative
3123,In another thread someone said that having the Gear VR app installed was causing this .,Negative
3124,My Galaxy S7 Edge did indeed overheat using the charger that came with the unit the adaptive fast charger .,Negative
3125,My wifes unit also gets hot to the touch while charging .,Positive
3126,As a result of my unit overheating it discolored and pitted the area around the Home Button very close to the charger connection .,Positive
3127,I was given a reference number then received an email that my complaint was without merit .,Negative
3129,Nowwith the bs update I have a two 600 useless paperweights .,Negative
3130,I am pissed .,Negative
3131,It looks like the phone was put on a hotplate .,Negative
3132,The battery hasnt vented so thats not what caused it .,Negative
3133,And it only seems to be melted around the edges those in which would be the first to touch a hot plate or frying pan on an oven .,Negative
3134,I say this because the CPU which is what generates the most heat in the device is located in the center by the camera not the outer edges of the phone .,Negative
3135,I think someone just tried to pull a fast one to get their phone replaced on you .,Negative
3137,Yes it is .,Positive
3138,damn I find the curve display so annoying .,Negative
3142,Says the guy using Generic Rectangular Block Phone 3698 ... I really hope they keep the 5.1 and 5.5 models whether they both have the edge or not .,Negative
3143,No idea why .,Negative
3146,Thats right ... I am buying iPhone 7 ... I have no idea why SAMSUNG does that .,Negative

3153,Ive been looking for some decent bluetooth earbuds .,Negative
3156,Lets just hope that it will eventually arrive ... hopefully ... Make believe clickbait .,Positive
3157,Samsungs flagship phones historically tend to get two major Android versions so it should .,Negative
3158,I want to believe but I seriously doubt it .,Negative
3160,More likely closer to spring of 2017 .,Positive
3161,N910G Note 4 in Australia still hasnt got it .,Positive
3163,Considering the update will have to go through my carrier I seriously doubt Ill have it by the end of the year .,Negative
3164,There are people in China who can afford it unfortunately .,Negative
3165,Yes they do only in black deleted Up until this point we never needed to contact customer service .,Negative
3167,This is why Ill never buy Samsung anything ever again .,Negative
3168,Their customer support is absysmal and the products dont last .,Negative
3169,Unfortunate my sons tab3 has touch go out on the screen rmad it they fixed it and sent it back no cost manufacturer warranty with no problems or issues had worked for almost 2 years since .,Negative
3172,prizelogic has been screwing me over too .,Negative
3173,Sorta late now but did you try to return it through where you purchased it before contacting Samsung .,Negative
3174,This would have been a perfect situation to do a cc charge back if you used an amex or some other cc that has their customers back .,Negative
3175,same here Key bank can suck my cock they owe me so much money Edit Two banks were removed they must have not been ready yet .,Negative
3176,They had Android Pay day one and Navy Federal beat them to the punch with Samsung Pay yet their customer service responses on this issue dont show too much hope .,Negative
3178,Unfortunately I dont think that Capital One has any plans to support Samsung Pay .,Negative
3180,It just goes to show that if smaller banks and credit unions can offer Samsung Pay support for their customers that larger banks and issuers have no excuse for not offering it too .,Negative
3181,A bunch of smaller banks I presume that Ive never heard of but I saw PNC and Im all good .,Negative
3183,Discover has said they wont be ready to support SP until early 2016 .,Negative
3184,Wells Fargo has no excuse since they are already supporting Apple and Android Pay .,Negative
3185,Supporting Samsung Pay would be extremely simple for banks already supporting Apple Pay and Android Pay .,Negative
3186,They probably want Samsung to pay them to support SP .,Negative
3187,Well I mean its usually quicker for me to either pay in cash or hand them a card .,Negative
3188,So I rationalized the added step of dealing with loading the app was that if I used it 5 times Id get a good reward .,Negative
3190,I mean I could have seen them scale it back a little be like OK you need to use it 10 times then maybe 20 etc etc. .,Negative
3191,But they went from like 5 times for like 6 months or so to like 50 .,Negative
3192,I switched banks for this reason .,Negative
3194,Its worth the 6 a month bank of America charged me for a checking account .,Positive
3195,WTF dude ... Ive only made like 5 purchases so far .,Negative
3197,You need to see Samsungs perspective too .,Negative
3198,Many people just use their service to get the giftcards once or twice Doing this they maintain customer loyalty while at the same time giving out rewards I just won the gear fit two on my second redemption of points .,Negative
3199,So theyre kinda cool .,Positive
3201,Credit card dispute is your friend here .,Positive
3202,Call your credit card company let them know what happened send them the tracking information and tell them that you havent received the credit yet .,Positive
3203,Yeah I suppose Im at that point now .,Negative
3204,I was hoping to publicly shame them into doing the right thing or to find contact info for someone in the company who could actually help me but I guess I should have known better .,Negative
3207,he doesnt give a crap about customer service either .,Negative
3208,And incredibly my credit card requires me to print and fill out a form that must me mailed to them with supporting documents to dispute a charge .,Negative
3209,... and both of my printers are unable to print the stupid 2 page black and white document because theyre each out of 1 of the color inks .,Negative
3210,... and my van has been in pieces the mechanics for 2 fn months now while he tries and fails to fix the ac .,Negative
3211,... and my car has expired inspection stickers and a broken windshield so I shouldnt be driving it anywhere other than the glass shop but I NEED MY MONEY BACK FIRST SAMSUNG .,Negative
3212,thanks for the replies and listening to me whine everybody .,Positive
3213,Credit card dispute definitely if all else fails return the Best Buy phone and use the one they shipped .,Negative
3214,The products themselves have been fantastic .,Positive
3215,Its Samsung.com thats the problem .,Negative
3216,Ive never needed to return a phone or get warranty repairs before dealing with them .,Negative
3218,I wanted an unlocked phone this time so I went to Samsung.com .,Negative
3219,Dont make that mistake and you should be fine .,Negative
3220,I keep hearing all these claims of from what Ive seen and mine has scratches and all I did is put it in my pocket and I believed the hype and have gotten more paranoid .,Negative
3221,But Ive seen little picture evidence to support the claims .,Negative
3222,Outside of display models the JRE video and a couple random pics on the net where are all the pics ... Ive also heard multiple reports of no scratches from everyday commuters to construction workers but like all things the negatives seem to get the most attention.Ive had mine since day one with a case covering the back and naked on the front .,Negative
3223,Ive been careful probably over protective and I have no scratches ... Yet ... .,Negative
3224,Fingers crossed but Im beginning to think the sky isnt falling .,Negative

3233,Good stuff .,Positive
3235,deleted yeah i felt the same way about it too .,Negative
3236,because for that i could use the fingerprint reader Yeah thats my main concerb with iris scanner i hope they update it so you can acitvate it by holding one of the volume buttons on lock screen or something similar My idea is to try a no lock screen app .,Negative
3237,It should attempt to open the phone when the screen is turned on which should be halted by the Iris scanner then just look at it This is the best tldr I could make original.confirms galaxy s7 active waterproofing issues.html reduced by 67 .,Negative
3238,Im a botgt This characteristic was also bestowed upon the Galaxy S7 Active released by ATampT a couple of months ago in June but following a water resistance test conducted by Consumer Reports it was determined that the Galaxy S7 Active variant was not as efficient in keeping water away from its internals as its standard counterpart.gt Samsung replied by stating that they ampquotStand behindampquot the Galaxy S7 Active IP68 certificate but more recently the company backtracked and confirmed that some Samsung Galaxy S7 Active units are faulty and their water resistance is compromised.gt In other words Samsung wonamp039t offer lifetime warranty for the faulty units and although new stock seems to have been shipped to ATampT prospective Samsung Galaxy S7 Active buyers donamp039t seem to have a way of determining whether the unit they are about to buy is part of the old or the new stock.chance itll be fine but is that 1 really worth a 700 phone .,Negative

3275,I usually skip around phones a bit and have never had a note for some reason .,Negative
3276,Id like a phone to stick with for a few years and this will probably be the one .,Positive

3312,This is wonderful news .,Positive
3313,Ive had an iPhone since the original and just today 15 minutes ago in fact ordered a silver S7 Edge .,Positive
3314,I mainly use my Apple Watch for reminders .,Negative
3315,Does the Gear S2 show reminders from your phone .,Negative
3317,Is it as good as they say .,Positive
3318,The Gear S2 is a pretty cool watch easier to navigate around with the circle dial vs. the crown thing on Apple .,Positive
3319,The only challenge is there are fewer apps but who needs so many specific apps on a watch anyway .,Negative
3322,I had every iPhone since the 2g but this phone is clearly in a league of its own .,Negative
3323,I actually havent bought a watch yet since the always on display is actually nice .,Positive
3324,If I do I will get the Huawei watch since I hated the moto 360 .,Negative
3325,Im experimenting with this transition and I miss my Apple Watch a lot more than I do the iPhone.Im coming from an iPhone 6s Plus to the S7 Edge .,Negative
3326,Mixed feelings so far but Im chronicling the experience in more detailhttp mariusmasalar.mesamsung galaxy s7 day 1 .,Negative
3328,Probably Android Wear over Gear S2 .,Negative
3331,Samsung Pay is supposedly coming to the U.K. and Spain along with the release of the S7 .,Negative
3332,Im sure Samsung will have some kind of promos aimed at U.K. Samsung Pay users when it is released there .,Negative
3333,I have 4 credit cards only 1 company is supported but that card is not yet supported.This is like the 3rd free swag Ive not gotten of no fault of my own ... Im really hoping they reintroduce expandable storage .,Negative
3334,That was one of their strongest selling points imo and I dont know why they went away from that .,Positive
3337,No notification or anything Aww I wish I got the headphones in black http promo.samsungpromotions.com So ATT .,Negative

3347,So should I turn off my onky means of communication while I am on vacation and need it .,Negative

3349,Im just annoyed the feds are involved now .,Negative
3351,Also what about my fit bit free gift Me No Yes but resells are different from retail sales .,Negative
3355,Interesting Typically the warranty does not apply to anyone except the original owner not you in this situation bc you bought it on swappa .,Positive
3358,Dont know why they wouldnt replace one that was bought through a 3rd party.If worst comes to worst go to www.bestbuy.comnote7info and sign up for updates .,Negative
3359,And go to the carrier store and tell them you bought it out of town or something to that effect.On another note who TF buyssells a gt2 week old phone on swappa ... edit words That wont work .,Negative
3363,I even tried doing it via online chat and was told the same thing .,Negative
3364,Cos thats so easy and risk free s Makes sense .,Negative
3365,Since Verizon occasionally does open enrollment for phone insurance thatll probably be your only way of hopefully getting onto a newer revision .,Negative
3367,The few times Ive used them I havent had any major issues but theres usually someone out there with a bad Asurion experience .,Negative
3368,Yeah Id contact the CPSC Maybe its a copy .,Negative

3371,^ \ InforTotesMessenger ^ ^ Contactmessagecompose.torTotesMessengerbot Shouldnt you read the post and realize that he said he would have called except its Memorial Day and therefore he cant .,Negative
3372,Well of youre willing to trust the device with information like bank accounts and card information you better hope they have everything secure with no possible intrusions .,Negative
3373,So maybe waiting is better then having a feature that comes with a great risk .,Positive
3374,Return it as Not fit for purpose if the watch was advertised as havingor going to have soon a feature and doesnt then the watch as it stands isnt fit for purpose .,Negative
3375,I know youre joking but still hate you for getting my hopes up I mentiond this in another thread about the same issue .,Negative
3377,They also advertised MapMyRun intergration as a premier partner.So I bought the watch .,Positive
3378,Then I learned that they lied about Samsung Pay as it wasnt actually available for the watch .,Negative
3379,Then I learned that MapMyRun actually wasnt available either with no plans of ever actually making it available in the future.The Nike intergration is absolute shit and has tons of problems so its nearly useless .,Negative
3380,And there are no other alternatives since the app store is a total and complete joke .,Negative

3394,AMEX is allowed .,Negative
3397,Its a really convenient way to pay .,Positive
3398,Youve bruised your phone .,Negative
3399,Your LCD is broken so the only solution is to replace it .,Negative
3400,This happened to my wifes S4 so I paid a repair place 80 to install new screen and LCD and it was good as new .,Negative
3403,The phone is piss weak .,Negative
3404,It will still plug into a pc fine backup all your info pics contacts etc. A replacement screen for s4 when I looked was about 120 quid and isnt too bad a job as the lcd unit in its entirety needs replacing replacing just the glass is waaaaay more complicated .,Negative
3405,Getting someone to replace my screen for me e.g. Carphone Warehouse was more like 160 quid and they will completely reset to manufacturer settings .,Negative
3406,Good,Positive
3409,Any chance you have a picture think I am having a similar issue Im sorry .,Negative
3411,I agree I wouldnt upgrade if it means my gear vr wont work its actually a upside down regular micro usb port in the pic not a usb c That looks a hell of a lot like Type C to me I think its just the angle but only time will tell .,Negative
3412,From that angle it looks a lot like a Type C .,Negative
3413,After I got my Nexus 6P I actually dont mind the Type C .,Positive
3414,The faster charging is my primary advantage .,Positive
3415,As long as Samsung does what Google does and includes a charging cable but a Type A to Type C cable I have no complaints .,Negative
3416,She is obviously an Apple fanboy .,Positive
3417,In this article http www.autoomobile.comnewsiphone 6s or samsung galaxy s6 a clear choice40023689she compares the S6 and iPhone 6S and says that the iPhone wins in the features department simply because of 3D touch .,Negative
3418,She does mention that the S6 has a heartrate monitor infrared transmitter and wireless charging but those are just mentioned as an afterthought as if they have no value whatsoever .,Negative
3419,It looks like its written by an apple fanboy He is no doubt paid by Apple .,Negative
3420,This is a worthless article .,Negative
3421,You could make the same argument picking an android phone with a better battery than the ip6 and say well you better switch platforms .,Negative
3422,gt11 hours of web browsinggt12 hours of video playbackI fucking wish lol This article literally says nothing relevant whatsoever .,Negative
3423,Considering the only real thing its comparing is battery life the iPhone 6 is still sad in every other category .,Negative
3424,feels like it the way the writer uses the word anyhow just makes it seem more opinionated rather than informative .,Negative
3425,especially as it does state it is better than other android competitors .,Negative
3427,Haha its actually my first Samsung device gt Signal anntannaeSignal anntannae courtesy of uZanderGarner thanksies Theyre the real MVP .,Negative
3429,SDI is still apart of Samsungs brand though .,Negative
3430,Accurate title I guess but this was my thought .,Negative
3431,Samsung is finger pointing and may be at the end of a lawsuit because of it .,Negative
3432,gtSamsung was quick to blame the battery for causing some Note 7 devices to catch fire but it has since widened its investigation after replacement phones using batteries from Chinas Amperex Technology also caught fire .,Negative
3433,Why is the thumbnail BestBuy PRC stickers I alternate between 2 themes Android N and Grace UXBut i think grace ux was pulled from the theme store I love the themes but I havent paid for any yet .,Negative
3434,My favorite free themes are called Alien Theme Vintage Mountains Whale Live Pug Retro and Impressionism .,Negative
3435,If I were going to pay for themes I would have a hard time choosing between Poppy Retro Cafe Theme and V window theyre super lovely .,Negative
3436,Theres also one called MaterialisticUIhttp i.imgur.comsDpZDdN.png that looks like what Daredevils Matt Murdock would look like if he were trapped inside a phone theme .,Negative

3440,Keeps me on my toes .,Negative
3442,Ill take it over my dying note 4 any day .,Negative
3443,I can barely get Bluetooth to work properly and my battery discharges faster than a virgin in a brothel .,Negative
3444,Galaxy S7E has the same issue .,Negative
3446,The practical application is when you go to show someone a photo and it takes 27 seconds to wake up the device and open Gallery .,Negative
3448,While I dont think this is going to be the same level problem as I had with my S6 Active on Lollipop I still think it is important to let the manufacturer know that it is something that should be addressed as if they dont already know .,Negative
3449,While it would be nice for it to have the memory to go back to where it left off this doesnt put me off of getting Note .,Negative
3450,I have tried a Note and iPhone and given both a try Note 7 please .,Negative
3451,I just cant do iPhone I dont like the ios or anything really .,Negative
3453,Plus the Note 7 has much more use behind it than the hardware I have found .,Positive
3454,In my book the Note still leads for me because I have other needs for it that iPhone does not have .,Negative
3455,Note 5 user here if you watch through to the second round the user opens the apps a second time and on the Note 7 they have to reload completely into memory .,Negative
3456,So your saying a program that is written to benchmark Apple products doesnt properly benchmark a Samsung product .,Negative
3457,Go ahead and try to argue the whole IOS and Android app thing and youll be wrong because Apple holds everything from its hardware to the software that it runs on .,Negative
3458,Samsung makes the hardware and then adds its own flavor to the software that Google maintains .,Positive
3459,Completely different it isnt an Apples to Apples comparison .,Negative
3460,Try comparing it to another Android phone instead youd be allot closer .,Negative
3461,Dang 8 years and we are still having this argument .,Positive
3462,Honestly these tests are useless for me becaues I dont care about a few seconds Wonder whats the next excuse after iphone wins the same test with Note 7 running 1080p or 720p Cant be worse than the note 5 ... if not Ill take the storage expansion and bad ram management over my note 5 all day.My phone isnt my overclocking gaming rig and benchmarking my phone is not important to me .,Negative
3463,I dont need it to render video or run over clocked for 8 hours on aida64 or prime 95 with ihigh temperatures.Some people really buy phones for reasons other than calling and media .,Negative
3467,Ah yes for all the times I want to open and then immediately close all of the apps on my homescreen .,Negative
3468,Exactly this the first disappointment for me was that the Galaxy Note 7 comes with the same specs as S7E but I still hoped that with Grace they will fix the ram managment issue and was proven wrong This submission has been randomly featured in rserendipity a bot driven subreddit discovery engine .,Negative
3469,More here https www.reddit.comrSerendipitycomments4xcsa1note _ 7_has_poor_ram_managment_as_well_xpost_from Very poor comparison would you buy a computer if it had the same performance .,Negative
3470,This is probably the best description of phone speed Ive read.http www.iphonehacks.com201503iphone 6 vs samsung galaxy s6 compared in a speed test.htmlAs you can see the difference between these rival flagships is really negligible .,Negative
3471,While the iPhone 6 proved to be ever so slightly quicker at loading some apps the S6 Edge was quicker at loading others .,Negative
3473,This is in India right .,Positive
3474,The guys writing is terrible too Meanwhile back in Cupertino Cyanogenmod .,Negative
3476,You make it sound like an excuse for what is a lousy form of adaptation .,Negative
3477,The diversity Android has is hurting the platform as it not only slows down timed updates but also causes competition within the platform that Isnt to any customers benifit .,Negative
3478,This darned thing has been bothering me ever since I got the phone.I know you can change the icon using the SIM setup in Settings but is there a way to COMPLETELY remove it.Id appreciate any help you can give.Thank you .,Negative

3485,Yeah ive got the 4k package on netflix .,Positive
3488,just not sure if it was in UHD 4K .,Negative
3490,Youll see all the titles available in 4K .,Positive
3492,The Netflix app says 4K UltraHD on all the shows that have it I think you must have the 4 stream package to stream in 4K Wow it appears mine has done the same .,Negative
3494,Same here I submitted mine yesterday Mine says th,Negative
3496,able to play with it tonight I will do the lay in bed and go through every possible setting thing.It is amazing .,Positive
3497,Already had a moment when my hands were too busy to unlock my phone wow that sounds nasty typing it and I was able to swipe with my knuckle and unlock with eyes.This thing is nice Black Package Disabler Pro or a similar app should be able to do it in as long as it takes to install the app .,Negative
3500,No it doesnt have a user replaceable battery as the back is non removable like the Note 5 .,Negative
3501,If you want one of those you would have to look elsewhere as Samsung seems to have abandoned the idea for their higher end phones .,Negative
3503,As a former ups driver I can tell you we know exactly when were delivering any phonelaptopelectronic .,Negative
3504,All apple products come from the same regional shipper and would actually prompt for a signature and state that an apple product is inside .,Negative
3505,When you have 8 of the same size same weight signature required package delivered next day on your vehicle its pretty simple to assume its the new galaxy .,Negative
3507,Good thing I dont live in California or I might have just got cancer.NOTE Lately reddit seems reluctant to recognize sarcasm or jokes .,Negative
3509,To think 2 years ago the largest issue was phones were bendable Having to reluctantly trade in my note 7 for a pixel XL .,Negative
3510,I would prefer to have a note but I wont be eligible for another upgrade when the time comes for the 8 to come out .,Negative
3511,Just a shitty situation for Note 7 victims all around ... Samsung has to pull out all the stops thats for sure Rumors are saying that theyre doing away with the flat screens to make the curved screens the signature feature .,Negative
3512,Prior to the Note7 I would agree .,Negative
3513,But I really think they perfected it with the Note7 .,Positive
3514,I go no case and have pretty much 0 accidental hits at this with itturning it in this weekend .,Negative
3515,Can only imagine it will get better from here on out Yeah would like edge to edge just have non curved screens .,Negative
3516,The key to having an edge phone is the case .,Negative
3517,Ive had zero unintentional edge hits when I have the case on .,Negative
3518,I definitely do have unintentional edge hits without a case .,Positive
3521,I have the same problem with my s7 .,Negative
3522,If they make the s8 like that Ill probably go with the Google Pixel instead .,Negative
3523,Get the F version of any device they produce its always unlocked and completely open .,Positive
3525,ex SM N910F Note 4 SM G935F S7E .,Negative
3526,The International Note 7 was SM N930F RIP .,Negative
3527,Samsung has no real reason to go with OLED to be honest .,Negative
3528,Super Amoled is the go to for Samsung due to Super Amoled being superior to Oled itself .,Negative
3529,Hence the Note 7 display .,Negative
3530,A ton of lightning going on spot on colors with 10 bit integration in the display and a contrast that would make an iPhone user cry .,Positive
3531,Yes please sell me a phone with potentially more shrapnel .,Positive
3533,There are a lot of other phones with built in batteries which are just fine .,Negative
3534,Yes Samsung will be fine .,Positive
3535,But I dont know about their smartphone division .,Negative
3536,This could really hurt them big time .,Negative
3537,Everytime someone flies goes on a train ect they will hear Note7 dangerous for the next year .,Negative
3538,I could easily see the Galaxy brand be permenantly hurt .,Negative
3539,At that point Samsung may decide to put less emphasis and investment in the mobile division and concentrate on their chip fab .,Negative
3540,Samsung may be on the same level as Sony HTC Moto ect and no longer the clear cut 1 Android brand .,Negative
3541,They already lost their crown in China and this will probably lose their crown to Google in the USA .,Negative
3543,Itll put investors on edge and high pressure on future products .,Positive
3546,So thats what they are doing with all those note 7 s pens Cortex A72 and A53 are mobile chips developed by ARM.I dont know how it would fair against intel since most chromebooks use Intel Celeron .,Negative
3547,Not going to lie this looks awesome .,Negative

3555,Ive never been a fan but Ive never had a curved edge phone .,Negative
3558,The fingerprint I would expect to be faster and of course when you have muscle memory to just do it from older phones .,Negative
3559,I think once you get used to using the scanner it will be more efficient .,Negative
3560,Like your muscle memory will position it right after a while and you will get used to swiping to unlock that you wont notice it as you do now with how you are just starting to use it .,Positive
3561,I assume in the next models they will have a more efficient way or even with updates that will make the iris scanner faster to use than to swipe the screen .,Negative
3564,at Best Buy if you pay the seven bucks to have them do it every time they fuck up they get a new one at no extra charge .,Negative
3566,Left is Black Onyx Right is Silver Titanium .,Negative

3575,A company using emojis in their wording and youre surprised that what they say is irrelevant Pretty sure theyre being tongue in cheek Apparently if you light your device on fire it gets burned .,Negative

3637,Also should stay away from looking too iOSy I preordered my phone and gifted it to my brother because hes in med school there for 6 months before any of this nonsense the phone is a Canadian note 7 but its in the UK .,Negative
3638,Shipping is ridiculous because its a bomb so now most couriers are very cautious taking it on .,Negative
3639,Samsung UK wont help and Samsung Canada wants me to foot the bill for shipping .,Negative
3641,T Mobile at least will give you a complete refund and let you do whatever you want with the money to get something else .,Negative
3643,Bought mine with the preorder deal at sams club ... Called sprint ... was told to go to sprint store ... went to sprint store ahhh dont worry about it it was only like 40 devices plus nothing here .,Negative
3644,My response was news articles and legit concerns which sprint did not care about ... was then told to take it back to where i bought it and hope they had one in ... called sprint back ... confirmed i have to take it to sams ... why the fuck do i have to take it anywhere specific if this is such an issue .,Negative
3646,For something that is so dangerous carriers are making this way too difficult .,Negative
3648,BestBuy for example will trade it for an S7 or S7 Edge but wont let you return that for a Note 7 when theyre available .,Negative
3649,The phone is not under a recall as of yet .,Negative
3650,Its still considered a voluntary exchange .,Positive
3655,Att and t mobile sound like theyre not interested exchanging .,Negative
3658,So at one point I was walking around with three lithium batteries and one of them is a ticking time bomb .,Negative
3659,Wow Samsung just wow .,Positive
3660,Smh ... People dont learn giving money to the same bad company when they are so many better phones out there .,Negative
3661,iPhones Pixels HTC 10 V20 and lots of great decently priced phones like OP3 Axon 7 etc. .,Negative
3662,When you are buying Galaxy you probably dont care about software so lots of options .,Negative
3665,Be happy that you didnt get to .,Positive
3667,Im switching to the iPhone 7 because its the only phone Verzion has an Annual Upgrade program on so I can hop back the Note 8 in a year and Im so grumpy about losing the Note 7 .,Negative
3669,After my second note 7 I decided to switch to the 7 edge and if Im being honest I actually wish I got the edge to begin with .,Negative
3670,Its a work of art and the perfect size and while I miss the s pen I find the edge so much more comfortable to hold and use .,Positive
3672,I personally went to the Note 5 for the time being .,Negative
3673,I had the edge and I felt like the edge was almost too ... edgy .,Positive
3675,Its a great phone .,Positive
3676,Much less lag than the note 7 and I actually prefer the screen .,Positive
3677,The main thing youll miss is the software features and SD card .,Negative
3680,I wont be getting the S7E .,Negative
3681,I used it as a loaner between N7v1 and N7v2 and I didnt like the edges .,Negative
3682,Its a fast phone and does great but with the S8 to be announced in Feb Ill be turning in the N7 and waiting .,Positive
3683,The rumors sound like its going to be a great device.Its not like the S7E is any cheaper than it was on launch .,Negative
3684,I work retail and I notice most people exchanging for the edge 7 i wish i could just get my s6 back since i only had like 180 in payments left .,Negative
3685,I went with the LG G5 and waiting for the LG V20 Exactly what my gf just did .,Negative
3686,Not like the people are all of a sudden smart .,Positive
3687,I got the S7E only because they didnt have the iPhone in Stock and I was sick and tired of exchanging phones ... .,Negative
3688,How did you get it for 420 Im looking for a cheap phone to get me through the year between now and the note 8 .,Negative
3689,Im considering a oneplus 3 because its 400 but a pixel xl at 420 might be too tempting ... .,Negative
3690,That sucks .,Negative
3691,I usually wait a month or so to get a device .,Negative
3693,I got a note 7 2 days later I get an email from Verizon to tell me about a shipping delay due to battery issues .,Negative
3694,I waited got it as soon as it was rereleased .,Positive
3695,Then this crap kept happening .,Negative
3696,Guess Im opting for an iPhone 7 for now I bought a used S4 for 90 bucks and Im gon na use that till I can get a Pixel XL .,Negative
3697,Me and Samsung are taking some time off to ree,Negative
3700,The official recall for the Note 7 is a 100 credit if you get another Samsung phone .,Negative
3701,I doubt youll see any more than that since the recall is Samsungs fault and not your carriers .,Negative
3702,Meanwhile your phone will continue to become outdated as all support is dropped .,Negative
3703,Why would they have a freaking limit on the number of users who could participate on the beta .,Negative
3704,Isnt more users equal more feedback thus more better software in the end .,Negative
3706,This is kind of dumb .,Negative
3707,I couldnt find it in the galaxy store until noon today uCoffeshots Update last night I checked the updates for my phone and I am now running android 7.0 Theres ways to flash a version of the beta if youre willing to try .,Negative
3708,I registered and got in ... One mate go on now i just deregistered for you youre more of a samsung fan than i am I tired too ... Ive just registered for it hopefully I get in I want to wait for the Pixel but i was loving the Gear VR I got .,Negative
3709,So I guess im going to have to for the S7 or the S7 Edge if i want to keep using it .,Negative
3710,Just recently the the Gear VR wont work for the Note 7 anymore Typed from My Grenade Doubt theyll ever sell it again .,Negative
3711,Yea essentially Samsung S8 remove the galaxy naming5 .1 inch screen no S pen .,Negative
3713,Samsung S8 Pro5 .7 inch screen S pen .,Negative
3714,Based on the Note 7 chassis.I know they insist on 3 flagships this year and 4 last year S7 S7 Edge amp Note 7 for 2016 .,Negative
3715,S6 S6 Edge S6 Edge Plus amp Note 5 for 2015 .,Negative
3716,because they want at least a new flagship phone every 2 financial quarters but at this point they need to revise their strategy to devote all resources to knock the S8 amp S8 Pro out of the park for the entire financial year instead.To me the S6 Edge Plus amp Note 5 are as redundant as the S7 Edge amp Note 7 .,Negative
3717,If the iPhone 7 Plus has to be competed against it would be phones based on the Note 57 chassis not S6 Edge PlusS7 Edge chassis.In my opinion .,Negative
3718,Ugh DAD How did the numbers get thrown off .,Negative

3736,You want your orders to get screwed up .,Negative
3737,Cause thats how that happens .,Negative
3740,keep calling their customer service and complain about it .,Positive
3742,Thats the date theyre saying for replacements but it is also the date to get one if you dont already own .,Negative
3743,This is actually very helpful news will make my job easier by evading them motherfuckin constant returns while we do the iphone 7 at the same time .,Positive

3761,A google phone probably would give me the same feeling a Nokia 3310 would have probably given me an even better feeling come to think of it .,Negative
3762,If you want more of a Vanilla feel to your Samsung device download Nova Launcher and Good Lock .,Negative
3763,Having owned every Nexus phone except the 6p the S7 edge is the best phone I have ever owned .,Positive
3764,Tried Sony HTC LG UMI .,Negative
3765,Just picked up a used Note 5 and kind of liking that also .,Positive
3766,Welcome to Android where everyone hates Samsung .,Negative
3768,If you like Samsungtouchwiz features such as pop up Windows Samsung pay wireless charging and many others plus you want a micro sd card slot then Samsung phones are better .,Negative
3769,But if you prefer the stock Android feel more timely updates less noticeable lag then the pixel is better .,Negative

3847,Best Ive experienced in a smartphone Ive about 20 of them .,Positive
3849,It is a perk of the job haha It saves energy because to turn on entire display just for time which is done roughly 150 times a day drains about 28 percent battery .,Negative
3850,This always on saves you doing so and in turn saves you energy I knew this gon na be happen one day though little late but since Apple has fierce following its not easy to defeat it .,Positive

3869,Samsung is an awful company .,Negative
3870,Regardless of this thought if he returned the phone he would have no evidence of the phone blowing up in the first place Thats an S6 edge .,Negative
3875,Will this higher storage option make its way to the major US carriers .,Negative
3877,If they take away microSD ... even with a 256GB option ... Would welcome this greatly .,Positive
3878,I think they need the spec for Chinese market and just to tout they have a 256gb variant like the iPhone .,Negative
3879,Id be happy with 64 or 128 plus micro SD.Cant see them returning to no SD card after the s6 debacle and the sheer popularity of the s7 line .,Negative
3881,Sometimes the price bumps for extra storage arent so outrageous and then there is Apple who is 100 for every tier .,Negative
3882,Im big on SD cards myself and dont really want a phone without one if i can help it but I would pay extra for more superfast storage in addition to SD cards if its reasonable and not a gouge.It would be nice to see if the S8 gets a basic storage capacity jump since iphone 7 has 32GB now .,Negative

3927,This is the real low light comparison.S6 top S7 bottomhttps imgur.comEBRvjIs except its not .,Negative
3928,the exposure lock was clearly taken in two different spots resulting in a different exposure where the S6 has blown out the highlights.the only way this experiment would have been fair was to set the camera in manual mode and match the values between the two phones .,Negative
3933,I got ta say one thing .,Positive
3934,The glass over my note 5 and s6 are terrible at getting oil on them .,Negative
3935,Every time I go to take a picture I have to wipe off the glass or itll look like the photo here .,Negative
3936,What Im getting at is o think the s6 had an oily film over the glass when this was taken because thats how mine looks when it has oil on it .,Negative
3938,Holy crap the camera is amazing in low light and its crispy af outside .,Negative
3940,S7 top S6 bottomhttp imgur.comlo3NlFb To be honest stereo speakers are not on my list to improve.Got a s6 and while I would like an improvement on that one speaker stereo isnt a big deal.I only use it for YouTube or other short video for music I use ear plugs wired or bt speakers.If they can fit descent stereo speakers without removing anything sure why not but I wouldnt want to swap anything present right now for them .,Negative
3941,Samsung wont add those because theyre useless ... Who cares about that kind of speakers when you have a audio jack or Bluetooth speekers .,Negative
3942,Besides who the hell listens to music directly from the phones .,Negative
3945,Theyve listened to consumers for the last few years .,Positive
3946,They brought back micro SD card support water resistance they made the phone thicker for a bigger battery and slimmed down TouchWiz .,Negative
3947,As long as they continue to listen to consumers and think rationally I think theyll keep the headphone jack .,Negative
3949,Phone speakers are going to sound like absolute tinny garbage even if there are two of them .,Negative
3950,My S8 hopes 1 .,Negative
3952,Seriously if companies like Xiaomi can have a 4050mAh battery for their own Note phones that cost much less Samsung should go all out .,Negative
3953,No one buys phone X because its 0.7 mm thinner than phone Y. 2 .,Negative
3954,More reduction of bloatware .,Negative
3955,I cant stand redundant apps like Camera amp Magnifier .,Negative
3956,For other apps that hardly people ever use like S Health or Samsung Gear DO NOT pre install them .,Negative
3957,If they need apps to sync with other devices like the Samsung smartwatch let them download them upon syncing rather than pre installing them .3 .,Negative
3960,The default apps amp settings visuals should take more cue from the Black Theme darker colors so less battery life is being consumed .,Negative
3961,Sure consumers can manually change to the all black theme but the average general public are somewhat too dumb for that .,Negative
3965,4GB RAM and disable the loading animations .,Negative
3967,_____________ Of course all that and VR performance and non exploding batteries would be enough to knock Apple of its spot .,Negative
3968,apple is garbagio mang .,Negative
3969,Im going to be so disappointed in Samsung if they remove the headphone jack .,Negative
3970,If thats the case I would just keep my s7 .,Negative
3971,stereo speakers plz no .,Negative
3973,They should work on keeping the phone from exploding and catching fire before worrying about speakers haha As far as Im concerned Samsungs brand has been permanently tarnished and I will not be buying a Samsung phone for the foreseeable future .,Negative
3974,Their handling of this disaster has been breathtakingly callous and stupid .,Negative
3975,That dude that breathed all that black smoke might get cancer and die decades earlier than he should.Hope he gets MILLIONS from Samsung .,Negative
3977,But making the same mistake that can cost peoples lives is almost unforgivable .,Negative
3978,Cheap ass phones deleted In the same boat here .,Negative
3979,Already gotten a few people Ive run into make comments like sure it wont explode etc. the s7 appears to be tarnished where I live because of this as well .,Negative
3981,To many people I meet Samsung now equals boom .,Negative
3982,Well the device has to be on in order for current to flow an the issue is something in the phone is heating up too much and causes failure .,Negative
3983,I assume theres too much current being drawn by the part that fails and either the battery cant handle it or the part gets so hot the battery fails and erupts .,Negative
3984,Probably will be permanent .,Positive
3985,Theres no 3 strike rule here .,Negative
3987,I have the S7 Edge and its been great .,Positive
3988,Not sure why this Note 7 has been such a disaster .,Negative
3989,The Note is usually very renowned because it has the best features of the Galaxy S in a bigger form factor and more refined software .,Positive
3990,The Note 7 is still that but clearly there was an issue in manufacturing and possibly even engineering in the battery .,Negative

3993,The phone works fine 100 and the drop really wasnt that bad .,Positive
3994,There was no damage done to the side trim and the case covers the back now .,Negative
3995,Ill just wait until something catastrophic happens before putting in a claim at this point .,Negative
3997,Maybe you can find a way to get it replaced with a back plate that doesnt have the horrendous Verizon tramp stamp .,Negative
4000,I pay much less than that for unlimited data .,Negative
4004,Im assuming mine only cracked since I heard the back glass isnt as strong .,Negative
4005,That phone is too expensive not to have a case on it If that were my phone I would activate the phone and leave it in the box until my case came in .,Negative
4006,Good luck on whatever you decide to do .,Positive
4010,That way you immediately get a brand new phone .,Negative
4011,If you wait you risk getting a refurbished replacement .,Negative
4012,Dude what happened Well thats a Q40 which make 328hpHow fast were you going.I doubt the magnet would hold up under heavy acceleration holding on to a large phone .,Negative

4017,I never really trusted those magnet systems especially with heavy phones.Bit off topic but I tried a ridiculous amount of car holders and they all had issues .,Negative
