120,mask with snorkel which I use when scuba diving Yesssss ... I just called Samsung uk to tell them this not in those words exactly but since our alternative solutions to the note 7 problem are just to get a refund and a new contract I asked if theres any way an actual solution like this could happen .,0
121,After some talking and being left on hold while she discussed with a manager she genuinely I hope made a note on my account and said to wait for a call back .,0
122,It might be that they are not aware that this sort of solution would help to make the situation better for note 7 users .,0
124,Id advise everyone in this situation call Samsung and let them know this option of getting a replacement s7 phone and an automatic upgrade when a new model is released would convince you to stay with Samsung and return your note 7 .,0
128,I know I have to return the Note 7 but I really dont want to go back to my Note 3 .,0
129,And now Im just waiting for the next Note .,0
130,This would entice me to switch to the edge until the Note 8 is available .,0
132,This and the booths at Airports are showing that Samsung is taking this seriously and going beyond for their users .,1
135,Regardless dont do it ... No expandable memory slot water resistance .,0

138,Unlocked bootloader isnt enough for me to change devices .,0

144,I would swap for a Galaxy Note8 2017 smartphone not Note 8 since thats a tablet _ Get a Note 4 .,0
145,Probably the best Note they have ever made .,1
146,I JUST bought a note 4 because I lost hope that this would ever even be brought into discussion .,0
148,The article states translated using Google translate According to industry sources Samsung has 17 days with an increase in the voice of complaints from consumers who purchased the Galaxy Note 7 reportedly being reviewed in order to establish a special program.They havent made up their mind on whether or not to do something for those that turn in their phone .,0
152,Well it may not necessarily be called the Note 8 .,0
153,They could give it a new name but it would still be a high end Galaxy phone with an S Pen .,1
154,pixel by then if true and the new one doesnt explode I would be so happy .,1
155,I went to the S7E and it is no Note for sure Only Samsung users would be silly enough to continue using inferior products .,0
156,As for this swap its the only way they can keep customers .,1
157,Unless removable batteries were already part of the plan there isnt enough time to add them in now .,0
160,I would trade my Note 7 in .,0
161,Right now I am holding on to it for a bit until Other phones release and I will re evaluate then .,0
162,Would be so funny if he got the same phone back just with a new battery P Holy shit i could never forgive myself In the future this idea of putting glass on phones will be seen just as a really stupid period in the technologies lifetime .,0
163,Till 9302016 I would think that a cracked back would be a big factor for the battery to overheat or at least I would play it like that if they gave you a hard time .,0
164,that sticker is holding it all together Att same thing .,0
166,Ez billions My buddy works for Verizon he said it is a total recall and they have been instructed to accept the trade in no matter the condition .,0

170,Was pretty happy they are accepting regardless of condition .,1
171,I was like meh well if they dont ill still use it screw it .,0
172,I was calling before ATampT and was like yea I wan na exchange and they were like sure sure then i stated oh and it has crack and they didnt want even though it may explode at anytime guess no resale value ha .,0
173,I was wondering what was the time frame we had to exchange our phones .,0
174,Like theoretically use the free exchange as some sort of insurance policy .,0
175,Hold on to your original Note 7 until the very last day of the turn in period so just in case your phone should break in one way or another during that time frame you would basically get a new one for free .,0
176,what He dropped it like its hot Took it off to see how much I liked a caseless phone since like I said they take it back in any condition .,1
177,This phone is so sleek it slides out of pockets way too easily for me haha .,0
179,Since three models of Samsung phones have been linked to severe burns in their users or exploding Id say get away from Samsung phones .,0
180,Im in the same boat as you and share a similar sentiment but regardless of the datedness of the S5 at this point lets be real that thing is a tank .,0
184,They no longer manufacture the Note 5 and likely dont have enough in supply .,0
185,There are reports they are ramping up production on the S7S7 edge though so it may be the case .,0
186,The S7 is seven months old and its out dated .,0
188,I have to admit I am extremely disappointed to see Samsung tank this hard on a flagship .,0
189,I currently carry the S7 Edge which I LOVE but I was looking forward to upgrading to the Note 7 .,0
190,The bigger screen was really appealing as was the functionality of the edge without the drastic bevel .,1
192,are you me .,1
194,I switched from the Note 3 to the pre ordered 7 decided to splurge and get the accessories came with the Gear Fit bought a wireless charging pad and Gear VR .,0
195,It truly is everything I want in a phone and it works with the accessories so well .,1
197,Note 5 isnt terrible .,0
198,The exynos is still no slouch even though its outdated .,0
199,I also had a Note 7 2 months after I bought a OnePlus 3 enjoyed it for about 2 weeks and loved the sh out of it before the explosion reports .,1
200,Unfortunately not even the Pixel XL can compare .,0
201,You wont find features such as water resistance s pen and dual sim on the Pixel XL.The Pixel hardware is nice but Googles default android software is so ... basic .,0
202,The Note 7 had so many features bloat .,0
203,added by Samsung that I really liked.I am now back to using my OnePlus 3 and I dont know what to get .,0
204,The only thing standing between me and a Pixel or even a HTC 10 is the dual sim feature .,0
205,March s8 ez Compared to the note 7 ... you have no idea .,0
206,Its very outdated .,0
207,I share your sentiments exactly .,1
208,Nothing out there is as good as the note 7 was so Im just going to hold onto my s6 edge .,1
209,If the S8 impresses me Ill probably buy one of those although I will miss the S pen.Its just a waiting game now .,0
210,I agree with you Although I have a note 5 which Im surprised to say Im decently content with ... .,0
211,I finally got the wife to upgrade from her s4 and shes absolutely gutted she wants her note 7 back in a bad way and the s7 edge doesnt really cut it So Im in the same place might end up giving the kids an s7 edge when theres a note 7 replacement .,0
212,Why not be constructive instead .,0
213,Im definitely keeping the phone .,1
217,Its a faster technology and it rules out errors from a badcheap microSD.one of the thing thats impressive is the water resistance without flaps like the S5 .,0
219,The ATampT variant will be running Kit Kat out of the box so when it gets upgraded to Lollipop people will forget about Marshmallow .,0
220,Im sure it will just be the new largest option similar to what 128 GB is today .,0
221,The s7 kind of adopted the note 5 style so I wonder if theyll keep it or change it up again .,0
223,Some videos around YouTube have also demonstrated it being used on both versions of the S3 so itll be there on launch.Though there is some conflicting information .,0
226,If somebody is buying this for the MST and doesnt have a galaxy phone they should wait for reviews .,0

240,I just want a replacement Note 7 but Ive been told too many different things now .,0
241,I went to Best buy asking for details and they said that they would replace it if I wanted to take an S7 or S7E but if I want a Note 7 still they wouldnt be able to do it because by the time they receive units Ill be outside of the 14 day period which Im out of already anyway .,0
243,The guy told me to call 1 800 SAMSUNG.So I call Samsung and the lady there asks my carrier and then she says to call my carrier and tell them that I already called Samsung .,0
244,I call Verizon customer service and they dont really know whats going on and said theyll have more info next week .,0
245,The dumb thing about all this in the first place is that I got a text message last weekend from Verizon saying go see the store you purchased the note from ... Which was best buy ... Most likely they will automatically ship it to you at a later date when Samsung give the all clear .,0
248,My s7e is still completely flawless with better battery life .,1
251,That phone is hot .,1
253,This is the best tldr I could make original galaxy note 7 recall reduced by 74 .,0
254,Im a botgt Samsung is preparing to announce a massive and global recall of its brand new Galaxy Note 7 smartphone according to South Korea Yonhap News Agency.gt Yonhap claims that Samsung is currently in discussions with carriers that have already launched the Note 7 Verizon Wireless is mentioned by name about how the recall process will be handled.gt This unnamed Samsung official told Yonhap that the battery issue impacts less than 0.1 percent of Note 7 devices sold thus far but clearly the company is unwilling to take chances.Extended Every one of them thats out there doesnt matter what kind of battery you have .,0
255,except the ones sold in China their batteries are from a different company why did they recall it .,0
256,I get mine in the mail tomorrow so ... thats cool I guess ... Removable batteries is usually a trade off for water resistance .,0
257,Feeling the exact same way unless its not going to be a hassle .,0
258,One report said it appears right now to be one phone in a million .,0
259,Im willing to gamble on those odds .,1

307,Can you explain how you did this .,1
308,Your future older self ears will thank Samsung for it P they were thinking they dont want to get sued Mine only appears once after each time i turn the phone on To cover the companies ass when Johnny the 14 year old metalhead blows his eardrums out with his Skullcrusher headphones .,0

343,As I only have a 5 Im so excited for this .,0
344,A usable pen in a powerful and compact little device .,1
345,Cant wait .,0
346,it blends a non bezel look without sacrificing viewable pixels as somebody who preordered the note 7 day one Im more worried that samsung will release a biggerbetter variant a couple months after release .,0
347,I am happy that I preordered this device while I love my Note 5 I feel that the software and S pen tweaks that the Note 7 has are certainly worth the upgrade to the device .,1
348,As I have Jump on Demand Ill be paying it off over the course of 18 months .,0
349,Since my Note 5 is in pristine condition that will allot me some nice credit towards paying off the Note 7 .,1
350,Was thinking the same thing The ability of buying a new battery and replacing the old one makes things easier imo .,0
351,whats wrong w the v10 battery .,0
352,the battery life is due to software amp the always on display the battery itself is fine if samsung has removable battery again amp comes with wireless charging sd card samsung pay shut up amp take my money .,0
353,the battery is the only reason i havent bought the s7 I cant help but giggle at this Fixing their batteries means your done .,0
355,I chatted with ATampT and they said I could exchange mine for an S7 which according to the rep is what Samsung is exchanging them for .,0
356,I dont WANT an S7.Samsung is supposed to be producing new non explosive N7s right .,0
357,I wonder if I give it a bit and go the ATampT store if I can exchange it for another N7.Edit Okay so ATampT has revised their statement as follows .,0
358,Customers with a Note7 may select a Galaxy S7 Galaxy S7 edge Galaxy S7 active Galaxy Note7 or any other smartphone and may also return any Note7 accessories .,0
359,If a customer chooses another Samsung device he or she will receive a bill credit of 25 per device.Customers will be also able to exchange that interim device for a new Note 7 in the future .,1
362,Kind of annoying how Americans can swap theirs in a week and we have to wait up to a whole month They will ship you a new one .,0
363,this is crappy man This whole comment does not make sense at all .,0
364,I just ordered this phone I wonder how long it will take for it to be shipped since the carrier I bought from said since it didnt ship yet it wont be shipped at all until the situation is handled .,0
365,I imagine this is going to take forever .,1
366,I might have to settle for the s7 Edge Well if your house burns down in the middle of the night and kills your whole family you might be lucky 36 ... I would send it back in and say you heard a weird crackling sound and smelled burning plastic so you turned the phone off and now it won turn back on Wonder how long it will be before I can walk into a Verizon store and buy one in stock .,0
367,I cancelled my order but I really wanted to give it a go and not stick with iphone but my current one is on its deathbed and im not sure if i can wait .,0
368,Same I may send an email asking for some reimbursement on the protector .,0
369,It is their fault the phone is faulty .,0
370,Ill just continue to use the word unacceptable until they yield .,0
371,Reps in stores can be as clueless as anyone .,0
372,Until this was official no carrier was going to stop selling the hottest phone of the year .,0
373,I wish that could be done would make transferring all my stuff to the new phone much easier .,0
374,Theyll probably need you to send it in before tho Worst brand of phones ever made .,0
376,Due to risk of exploding battery Hoverboards and Samsung note 7s are no longer allowed on public transportation.JKSrsly tho 900 bucks for this thing and ive been sleeping with it next to my head bc of my sleep tracking app .,0
377,Just talked with sprint about this and they are saying that a new batch will be out next week .,0
379,How the hell do I know Im getting a brand new phone and not the one in your pocket right now with the battery replaced .,0
380,Probably closer to 5 Billion in losses Oh no Time to save up for an off contract version Arent people used to the fact that Carriers in general shit on flagship phones with bloatware .,0
381,So how does one get rid of this DT Ignite .,0
382,Im not surprised its Verizon doing this .,0
383,Honestly ... the fact that they emblazon their logo on the back of phones and Im sure we all remember the Galaxy Note IIs home button with the Verizon logo just shows how greedy they are .,0
384,People now realize that we pay full price for these devices ... there should not be any carrier name or garbage bloatware on the device .,0
385,Should be able to just download the carriers app for account management none of this other BS added .,0
386,Too funny Start with an alarming headline then spend the whole article explaining how its not that bad.From the article 1 .,0
387,It only runs on first setup or factory reset .,0
388,It never adds apps afterwords .,0
389,It does add initial bloatware but anything installed by it can be uninstalled unlike apps built in to the system image .2 .,0
390,The data used by it doesnt cost you .,0
394,It was an anomaly that the S7 didnt before this .4 .,0
395,You can disable the app if you choose.If you didnt already know that VZW plus Samsung equals preloaded bloatware then you havent been on rverizon or rsamsung very long .,0
396,The waterproof thing is the only thing that I miss about my S5 I loved that phone but just recently got a note 5 I LOVE IT Im in ... Ive been considering to go from my note 4 to a nexus but if its waterproof theres no way If they learned from their mistake with the s6 and brought back expandable storage on three s7 ... theyd be morons to not do the same for the note 6 .,0
398,Working in a third world country ... the Internet is not reliable nor his the speed to use cloud storage .,0
399,Be glad if they brought the storage back .,0
404,Im pretty sure youre not going to get removable battery with Note 6 ... Looks like weve found this years Savage device More ram sameish screen size waterproofing exynos processor .,0
407,Hell Yea for jump on demand .,0
408,They probably dont want to do 4k yet so they can keep using the same gearvr headset .,0
409,I just upgraded from my Galaxy S3 ... I feel like its been worth the 4 year wait .,1
413,Is the problem still there or has the updates fixed it .,0
414,Galaxy S6 was pretty bad .,0
415,I think its improved from the older blue and green version a lot but still they could make it a lot better .,0
417,My GS5 has been beat to shit as a result of a car crash accidental drownings and that time I tried to catch it with my foot but accidentally kicked it across the room .,0
418,Im just trying to make it to Christmas as this point .,0
419,Isnt it better to pay double that off contract .,0
421,Canada bud .,1
423,Good looking out .,1
424,I might wait until Christmas for those deep discounts to kick in .,0
425,EDIT Oh my god it went down to 150 .,0
426,Thanks usamsung.http i.imgur.comdZ9koS1.png Whats wrong with American .,0
428,Not only will there be discounts there will also be Galaxy S8 in the near future .,0
429,I recommend you wait for that device .,1
431,I was about ready to get a note 7 so if the s8 has the pen Im sold .,0
433,They had ideas they couldnt complete in time that were kicked down the road to the S8 before the S7 was even released .,0
435,My S6E was the phone that got me excited about phones again after the fall of Motorola.I just want Blue Coral .,0
436,If the S8 Edge has a more subtle edge like the Note 7 and is more rectangular again like the Note 7 Ill buy that in a heartbeat RIP I think they should be working on batteries .,0
437,I cant wait for Gear VR on a 4K screen .,0
438,Yeah lets hope if all goes well then this could be my very first Samsung phone.Was gunna be the note 7 but ya know shit happened .,0
442,They pushed out an update that prevented it from charging above 60 percent .,0
443,Then the Gear VR pushed out an update to prevent the Note 7 from being able to be used in the device .,0
444,No reason that they cant completely cripple it .,0
446,In other words blacklist them all just like they would if it was a stolen phone .,0
447,For liability purposes you would think that at some point they almost have to do that .,0
448,Somewhere out there you could in theory have someone who doesnt know about a recall .,0
451,As much as I would like to see a Note styled S8 I really doubt theyd have a model done for the launch febmarch .,0
453,But I dont necessarily buy phones because they look pretty .,0
454,I dont know of one person who has an edge phone that doesnt wish it was flat .,0
455,There are no viable uses for the edge that Ive seen .,0
456,Its a gimmick plain and simple .,0
457,And I will just continue to stock up on Galaxy Note 4s instead .,0
458,Damn I may need to pick one of these up .,0
459,Perfect design choice btw How hard is it to use .,0
460,I want to clone the watchface I made in Pujie Black for the Gear s2 Im gon na get .,0
461,Blows away the custom pebble watch faces I used to make ... Very nice .,1
463,I cant find Gear Watch Designer in the store ... Edit I found the link here Im surprised its a computer program .,0

465,Both are Breitling NaviTimer 1884 models .,0
466,The all black is the limited edition .,0
467,Wanttttt How is ambient mode .,0
470,Hate that .,0
471,Only reason I own the note is for the removable battery .,0
472,This video is a fake render made by another redditor .,0
473,How Man I was really hoping it would be 4k for vr Man Im so stoked for this .,0
475,If this is an edge only product Im not interested.Id still like the IR blaster back too.Is the MicroSD port U3 UHS2 .,0
476,much faster extra pins backwards compatible with old cardsIs the USB port USB C. Samsung Marketing.You dont think these are actual leaks do you .,0
479,the article that this piece is based on went onine in korea arpil the 1st http english.etnews.com20160401200002.the still is taken from google display 23 maybe 4 year old kaynote from ces fia or mwc does not matter .,0
480,the same year the sXedge prototype was demoed https so it was 2013 .,0
481,Until someone creates a better one .,1
484,Wont open at my work .,1
486,If so it was previously to be released in January 2016 but of course it was pushed back again .,0
487,It is a great concept and can do away with the tablet once and for all .,1
488,I can use a 2 in 1 .,1
489,Its not as easy as you think .,0
490,Probably not most people here seem to be pretty cynical .,0
491,Thats why I love Samsung they never give up and are always trying to improve .,0
492,Foldablity has implications for VR that could be interesting .,0
493,A single flat pane a couple of inches from your face isnt the best way to get stereoscopic images to your eyes .,1
494,When I registered my s7 edge they sent me an email with a coupon code to take 30 off any accessory from the Samsung site .,0
496,With tax and shipping 56.12 total .,0
497,If youre registering a new phone you may get a code as well Probably an s7 Mine did as well last night .,0
498,LOL I just realized I had my gun in the picture .,0
499,I just came home and changed so didnt out it back on when I grabbed my mail .,0
501,I sold my g3 19 rtf2 with gills last year for 1k .,0
502,I felt naked without my Glock I almost prefer the free charger to the fast wireless chargers I have just because the regular charger doesnt seem as finicky when placing the phone on it to charge The offer has already expired but if you use Pay before the end of the month you can get a 30 gift card for a couple stores Ebay Whole Foods Nike or BestBuy I got a charger from for 4 Works greathttp Yep got mine yesterday .,0
503,Seems to work really nice w my 7 edge .,0
504,Sounds like you need to contact Samsung and file a claim with USPS or FedEx .,0
505,Either someone stole your packages or they were delivered to the wrong address .,0
506,For the last promo FedEx delivered my wireless chargers to my next door neighbors door step so check with your neighbors and be sure to file a complaint if they delivered to the wrong address .,0
507,I see theyve fancied it up since I got one last year for my Note5 .,1
514,So at least thats something 2 deleted 50 off isnt even a great deal some people were under the impression it was going to be nearly freeDunno about korea but pretty much anywhere else you can sell a year old phone for at least half the value which is essentially what theyre offering as compensation for a major fuck upHere in Canada the S7E has a trade in value of 325 currently with every new flagship release they have a 150 200 discount if you trade in a phone and that combines with the trade in value of your phone so thats a 525 discount if the value doesnt dropUnless I misinterpreted the offer and you dont have to trade in your phone then its still pretty ass since youll have to sell it anyway if youre getting a new phone cool story Very disappointed its not for everyone still using Samsung devices and Im on an Edge plan with Verizon .,0
515,I went with an S7 Edge and Im actually not too torn with the direction theyre taking this .,0
516,I mean they are giving us Samsung loyalists for lack of a better term 50 the newest phone via trade in .,0
519,y then.I know people will argue that its not enough for our troubles but its a lot better than nothing at all .,0
521,Sprint wouldnt give me a refund on my note 7 they would only exchange it for a phone I didnt want .,0
522,I contacted Samsung and they sent me a return kit to get a full refund on the device .,0
523,Central jersey Seems so .,0
524,My guess is they will advertise it alongside a new gear vr with the usb c connector .,0
527,noooooooooooo oh hey is it water resistant .,0
528,Via https www.techtastic.nlsmartphonesnieuwe foto verschenen van waterdichte galaxy note 7 ... .,0
531,Especially a realtree otterbox defender .,0
533,Not much of surprise The other sensors are covered by the sticker or not there .,0
534,I thought it was going to have forward facing flash and retina scanner .,0
535,I dont think i saw the home key ... Edit Nvm turned brightness up and saw it ... I love looking at the displays of the silver version .,0
536,It looks so freaking elegant .,1
537,I just know that if I owned it the finger prints would drive me insane .,0
538,Not surprising its selling so well .,1
539,I do love my S7 Edge .,1
542,I have no idea .,0
543,I think Samsung did the right thing in recalling all of the devices and they shouldnt be liable for the carriers charges seeing as the carrier and Samsung are two distinct entities with different business operations .,0
545,Edit to kill off Note brand_id86498 .,0
547,Maybe in a year or two Ill reevaluate after I see how Samsung has handled things and what direction Google is headed with their project .,1
548,I dont buy it .,0
549,90 of Note 7 owners got replacement Note 7s with the first recall.And your title is wrong .,0
550,The online survey was done among Samsung phone owners not Note 7 owners .,0
551,It likely captures a bunch of clueless consumers who dont actually have Samsung phones .,0
553,These survey dont mean shit when youre only surveying a very small percentage of Note 7 owners .,0
554,A survey of 1000 people doesnt say much Im taking a long break from them .,0
555,The note 7 was the first phone Samsung made that I really liked .,1
556,I have no interest in the s7 or s7e and I doubt Ill have any interest in any of their phones for awhile .,0
557,No just a very very very small of those devices 3.4 failures per million is 6 sigma the problem is that they dont know where it is failing .,0
558,Since they cant reproduce the failure .,0
559,I used to have LG phone ... man never going back to LG ever again Same here it was my first and last samsung ... gt Samsung ProductFTFY My first phone was an LG Chocolate from that I went to the Galaxy S3 and S4 and than to a Note 7 .,0
560,I do love Samsung ... but after this recall I think Ill try the Pixel XL .,0
561,Ill probably go back after though .,0
564,The same people will neither fly on a Boeing plane nor use a Dell computer ever again .,0
565,Be safe out there buddy 40 of that 40 will likely change their mind once the new phones come out anyways .,0
567,Here are the instructions http Maybe they can have Hanjin ship them back to Korea .,0
568,Oh wait ... Imagine that .,0
569,The phones all start acting out on board a flight ... Like popcorn ... Very unsafe popcorn .,1
570,Definitely not getting the same treatment here in Canada .,0
571,I called my service provider today and they told me I have to ship the device back expense out of pocket or bring it back to the point of purchase which is far from where I live .,0
572,I paid to have the device shipped to my house in the first place and now I have to pay to ship it back because the device they offer explodes .,0
574,What a shitstorm XD Got sent one of these when returning my Iphone 6 plus and receiving my Note 7 I thought it was an accident but they mustve known all along id need it .,0
576,Got my phone back and the displayed battery life dropped dramatically after update.So I just got my note 7 shipped to me today .,0
577,Went online and confirmed via the MEI number and everything .,1
578,Weird thing though .,0
579,The battery power was at 43 when I started the software update .,1
581,Im betting Samsung just flashed new software in all the replacement units and sent them right back out the door .,0
582,Their fix for those who had not yet replaced their phones was a software update that would not allow the phone to be charged above 60 of capacity .,0
583,The iPhone 7 is a marketing disaster with the jack gone and as always with apple no goddamn important new feature except that its a cheap cashgrab as always with apple and the Note 7 literally a safety hazard ... I guess youre right Noticed this myself today .,0
584,Got my new phone last night and Its seemed really leggy at times much more so then my original N7 swapped one out here for a customer in VA. .,0
585,Powercycling constantly The first couple days on a new phone is always like that .,1
587,I have my Note5 since release and see no reason to upgrade besides expandable memory and water resistance .,0
588,The curve screen still turns me off I consider this Note 7 to actually be the 6 cuz of the bad luck its had .,0
589,Just cant skip it .,0
590,how can they tell its the battery being drained faster and not the limit Samsung is now putting onto how much charge the battery can even hold .,0
591,Didnt they reduce the capacity .,0
592,I believe they made the s5 mini without a flap and Im fairly sure it is still water resistant .,0
593,My girlfriend has the S5 and personally I like it a lot more then the S6 .,1
594,Where as the S6 does have its pros I think it tried to be to much like an iPhone and strip away some of its key features that made is a galaxy Id also wish for a device that was CIT customer interface test tested and with an IMEI that can be linked to the date of manufacturing.Since my first S5 wasnt CIT tested and the IMEI for my Tab S says it was manufactured 43 days after I purchased it .,0
595,I miss that feature ... Replaceable batteries would be nice too .,0
596,I dont want to have to buy a new phone in 18 months if I can buy extended batteries for 30 .,0
597,The AMOLED is enough reason for me .,0
598,After the 4k tv and QHD phone screen I cringe looking at 1080p .,0
600,Ive had the S2 S4 S5 amp S6 .,0
601,The only screen Ive managed to crack is the S6 .,0
602,The same reason they would get rid of the external SD Card because they dont give 2 shits about customer satisfaction .,0
603,The s6 active S6 active Really .,0
604,Im not big into phone specs and it seems that all flagship models are pretty much the same .,0
605,So I went with the one that could put up with getting wet .,0
606,The same happened to my s7e and my battery drained halfway through the other day .,0
607,I did get another update a day later that apparently patched the problem since my phone is running normally now with the app installed .,0
609,They all came through today after I deleted VR and soft reset .,0
611,My battery was running at 174 degrees .,0
612,You get the current black one with usb c so yes it will work for the Note 7 .,0
613,Mine got approved yesterday .,1
614,D Me too .,0
616,Sure but whats an SoT .,0
617,I did this as well and its amazing the difference .,1
621,Its inexcusable ... I cant even use Google fricking Chrome right now because of the media server battery drain issue .,0
622,Who is manning the ship at the Play store right now .,0
624,Hitachi is normally my go to for storage but I just replaced a four year old Seagate 750 GB HDD primary drive in a VAIO with a Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SSD .,0
625,Also have a Hitachi 1TB internally as secondary .,0
626,Couldnt be happier after fixing Windows Update .,0
627,Definitely worth it .,1
628,I probably restarted thirty times today .,0
629,Not one boot and log in took more than five or ten seconds .,0
630,I spent more time typing my password than it spent booting .,0
631,Looks like 250 to me .,0
632,Ive had few samsung drives mostly 320gbs f1 spinpoint series 9if i remember correctly .,0
634,Currently i use samsungs 850 pro ssd 256gb with hitachi 3tb hdd drive best drives in case of faulty devices in first years of usage .,0
635,Ill easly recommend hitachis hdd to anyone wanting a reliable hdd .,0
636,Samsungs ssd is alright but for the price point it could be even better or little cheaper .,0
637,Im going to buy a 950pro soon but im waiting for a good promo currently its a bit expensive 512gb version .,0
638,Less succeptible to shattering the camera glass and lets it lay on flat surfaces easier without wobble Put S7 in shopping cart True no heart rate sensor and not as round as the other pictures .,0
639,Its because the S6 is very thin and until Samsung recently came up with a new thinner camera sensor this is all they had to work with .,0
641,Good news hopefully cases covers wont cause edge shadow when taking photos I went to the Best Buy and Verizon Wireless stores in my town in Ohio and they had several colors of the Note 7 at each store .,0
644,I honestly am reminded of my old iPhone back when they were king .,1
645,Ive only had one bad lag issue but that was after forcing the phone to exit the demo video .,0
646,The black is very nice and I hate black phones .,1
647,Havent seen the silver but thatll be the one I get Had a YUUUUGE lag issue after leaving the Note 7 demo video where the phone froze for a solid 5 seconds .,0
649,So I wouldnt worry about that .,0
650,I almost forgot the edge was there .,1
654,The edge is MUCH tighter .,0
655,As somebody who despised the edge I really like it .,1
656,As far as feeling the Note feels very ... Sturdy .,0
658,My manager is going to upgrade from his S7E he got like 2 months ago .,1
660,I really want to see some storage benchmarks .,0
661,Antutu and or geekbench No complaints from me .,0
662,I played a song off Youtube Katy Perry I think and it was pretty clear .,1
663,Bit louder than my Note 5 .,0
665,Not all heroes wear capes .,0
666,Some just choose to play with phones while theyre bored .,0
670,but you said it is not as loud .,0
671,Can you double check it .,1
672,Also wonder how the battery life is but I know you can not test it because it is always plugged in .,0
673,Unfortunately I cant set a lock up due to the demo security features .,0
674,I did do the iris scanner demo and it worked great .,1
675,Take it with a HUGE grain of salt though .,0
676,Im guessing you mean if Im accidentally hitting the edge like what happens with the S7E .,1
677,I havent done that once at all .,1
678,The edges are much tighter and not as prominent It requires the new USB C gearvr which hasnt shipped yet .,0
681,Pretty nice .,1
682,Better than my Note 5 for sure .,1
683,Very accurate and great coloring .,1
684,Not OP but I also played with a demo Note .,0
685,Its still plastic but it doesnt feel awful and cheap to me .,0
687,As a demo device Samsung security doesnt let me power the device off or reset .,0
688,Should be able to .,1
689,Ill test in a secondEdit Looks like our store pair of headphones are MIA .,0
690,Ill try to remember to bring my own to test it .,0
691,As far as the S Pen I feel like it got a well needed face lift .,1
692,Much more precise and I can see myself using it for quicker note more often .,1
694,I hope this is true .,1
695,I passed on the S 6 and Note 5 because of this .,0
696,Id say 128 if there was no SD card otherwise 64 a card seems reasonable Both should be a given ... I like expandable storage .,0
697,It makes switching phones 10x easier As someone who works for Samsung within Best Buy and gets customers like you fuck you sir .,0
699,I had the Note Pro 12.2 and got rid of it for a Chrome book but would definitely get rid of the Chrome book for this .,0
700,I used one of the first 14.3 Full HD chrome book 2s I thought chrome.os.looked like shit .,0
702,its windows all.over again isnt it.That said ... .,0
705,Samsung nailed whole curve screen thing with Note 7 .,0
706,They finally got a perfect balance between look and functionality Yes S6 Edge had their share of problems but you should try Note 7s curve its definitely problem free .,1
707,That edge was very big .,1
708,I brought back my S6 edge plus the day after I got it because of this .,1
709,Completely unusable without a case .,0
710,Gambled and got a S7 Edge after that .,1
711,It was still a bit annoying .,0
712,But I could use it with no case just had random letters tossed in my sentences sometimes .,0
714,Works amazing with no case .,1
715,The edge is perfect .,1
716,I have an S6E and and as the phone is beginning to rapidly age and get ready to go out to pasture I have to say I enjoy the edge .,0
717,It looks nice and I find gripping it with a case more natural than a slate phone .,1
718,Curve on the back flat for the screen .1 .,0
719,Same benefits maybe better because more ergonomic like smaller easier to handle and more comfortable .2 .,0
720,Less accidental touches when reaching across with your thumb or holding the phone landscape the drop down menu always seems to trigger when I watch things .,0
721,Its not perfect but I like it .,1
723,hopefully theyll pass them through fast Oh the feels Awesome means the Note 5 should see it sometime before the next round of the olympics after Brazil .,0
725,Hes awesome and the commercial is awesome .,0
727,After recently switching from iOS to Android I love stock Android MUCH more than TouchWiz or Tizen for that matter .,0
728,I would not get another Samsung .,0
730,With these and Package Disabler Pro Im actually at a sweet spot right now that Im VERY happy with my S6 except battery life .,1
731,REALLY cant wait for the new Note .,0
732,Yeah I wish I could just get android wear on my gear s but when I look into it its all forum posts of people telling people asking that its stupid because the tizen is allows features like calling but honestly the barren app store stops me from bothering to charge the watch at all at least android wear has 3rd party support ... Oh and s voice is the worst voice command platform I have ever used As nice and well built as my S7edge is the most important feature is that its an android phone .,0
734,But I dont like iOS or Windows phone and wouldnt buy them no matter how great the hardware is .,0
735,Id go Nexus or Oneplus if samsung abandoned android .,0
736,Im not going to a barren ecosystem run by a company that would charge huge pric,0
740,Why would you possibly buy Android devices if you hate Android .,0
741,Lol Touchwiz is not an operating system .,0
742,Neither is good lock .,1
743,They all run on Android .,0
746,Hopefully project ara is out by the time I need to replace my s7 Totally .,0
747,I have had all three iterations of the MotoX but it wont be next phone if I get another Android it will Nexus .,0
748,Why would you dump Android .,0
749,I just bought the S7 Edge and Im running as close to stock android as I can .,0
750,I deleted or disabled as many samsung or 3rd parties apps as I could .,0
751,The smart idea would to run stock android and the google launcher and dump touch wiz or wiz home whatever its called.Samsung hardware and Android software thats the key .,0
752,Yup I wouldnt buy a Samsung phone without Android .,0
753,Id probably switch to a Nexus .,0
754,I wouldnt care because I wouldnt be buying another device from them .,0
755,If they really go this way it will be a total shit show .,0
756,I just upgraded from the s5 to a 6p .,0
757,Best feature is the stock Android .,0
758,No more Samsung phones for me then .,0
760,I have so much information tied to Google at this point that switching would be a giant pain in the ass .,0
761,All of my 2 step verifications lay through Google my maps reviews and so much more is with Google .,0
762,Anyone here that says Tizen is bad because of the wearable version is really uninformed .,0
763,Tizen runs in so many Samsung devices and the central point of focus is usually the same advanced tech that is simple for the user and opens doors for mobile that have not been touched yet .,0
764,Samsung with android is nice but they havent scratched the surface with what they are capable of yet .,1
767,That was by far the best phone experience I have ever had .,1
768,Not perfect nothing is but a true joy to use on a daily basis .,1
770,It introduced some good improvements but took away some of the best parts of 8.0 .,1
771,Then I installed the preview for 10 which was a huge POS in my opinion .,0
773,I still lament the direction MS went with Windows Phone and what could have been .,0
774,I value Samsung brand name too much to not freak out .,0
775,I bought a sub par for price J5 against other competition simply because I didnt trust their after sales service .,0
776,People would eventually stop calling every Android phone a Samsung .,0
777,So itd be nice i wouldnt care if they did .,1
778,i wouldnt buy anymore phones from them but i dont care if they made the swap .,0
780,but i need playstore They better not.I have bought every Galaxy S starting with the S2 and I wouldnt buy a Samsung without Android on it .,0
782,I do love Amoled phones but I dont love them more than Android .,1
783,Theres not even enough room for 3 windows phone market share below 1 percent One way ticket to lose their market share .,0
785,It looks like HTC is finally turning things around .,0
786,This would be a great time to go back .,1
787,In a way I hope Samsung does as this should spell the end of Tizen and we can one day hope to see Samsung Android Wear watches hit the market.Edit grammar As much as I think Samsung makes good phones not really .,1
788,Id probably just get an HTC .,0
789,Thats why Google sold Motorola to Lenovo to keep Samsung happy .,0
790,If they were going to attempt this they should have done it years ago If this meant what it currently means for my S Gear 2 piss poor app selection laughably bad voice recognition from S Voice no Google Now or Google apps integration then off to Nexus and Android Wear I go .,0
791,I wouldnt buy another Samsung if they ditched Android .,0
792,I like Samsungs products but theyre not head and shoulders above other handsets for me .,0
793,Im much more investedinterested in continuing to use Android .,0
795,Id never consider another Samsung phone if it wasnt running Android .,0
796,I want Google Android more than I want samsung .,0
797,I love Andoid OSSoftware way more than Samsung HardwareDesign .,1
798,If Samsung drops Android then my next upgrade would be too the next best Android device after that .,0
799,I litterally cant imagine owning a cellphone tablet without the Google Play Store .,0
800,at first probably not .,0
801,but to be 100 hones if samsung does good with tizen and makes it actual competition for android or IOS then i would consider it .,0
803,That color is so pretty.Anyways if a reboot didnt fix it then the flex cable is probably just partially lifted .,0
805,When I overclocked my phone to 2.3 Ghz on core and 800 Mhz GPU this happened to me once I unlocked my phone .,0
806,One restart later and it worked properly .,1
807,In rest I didnt OC it anymore and it works properly now .,1
809,Yeah its pretty neat .,1
811,Decent for fitness tracking now makes payments almost anywhere a card reader is installed basic notifications etc. .,0
812,Its not life changing but it can be nice to have .,1
814,Im getting it for the MST payment system its as close to magic as you can get D MST wasnt available on the S2 and the addition of it on any Android phone is a huge bonus .,1
815,Youve just upgraded your phone to pay for stuff on just about any magnetic card reader .,0
816,Seems a bit crazy that their brand new product is getting a Black Friday sale .,0
818,I had the S2 since release these new designs and features makes me wan na upgrade .,0
819,Though its really up to your wrist size The S3 had some minor UI and software tweaks .,0
821,I have no need for the new features and the S3 is a bit too big i think Theres a beta for the iOS right now as far as the Gear Manager goes .,0
822,Pretty soon im sure theyll release the final product .,0
823,Well as far as inbox and hangouts you wont get a separate app available on tizrn you simply get notifications and can reply to them .,0
824,As far as google now unfortunately the tizen os forces you to use s voice .,0
825,Its kinda awkward anyways to talk to your watch rather than just your phone .,0
827,Its still a good os for the watch though very smooth .,1
828,Im a big screen person so Im HYPED .,1
829,I was hoping theyd make AN S2 with a bigger screen but this is even better .,0
831,Yessss Plz Tizen honestly isnt bad .,0
832,Been using my Gear S2 with no problem .,0
833,Only gripe i have is the lack of variety of apps thats it Ikr .,0
834,Though the pricing im concerned about since it looks rugged and has sporty features .,1
835,I hope its not as expensive as the Garmin Fenix 3 which is around 500 or hopefully it doesnt get as expensive as 400 Im relieved .,0
836,I already spent 880 because there was a phone that was slightly better than mine .,0
837,I didnt want to pony another 350 for a watch .,0
838,My beloved S2 is safe looking all svelte on my wrist .,0
840,LOVE the IR blaster on the note 4 they better include it in the 7 .,0
841,Its a flat screen variant .,0
842,Lots of people including myself dont want an edge version .,0
843,Pure marketing and probably a good idea .,1
845,The iPhone 7 is likely around the corner .,0
846,They dont want an uninformed consumer to think that the Note 6 means previous generation .,0
847,Hello beautiful .,1
849,Agree While I love my Note 2 especially with the Note 4 based Eclipse v8 rom I really looking forward to upgrading to the Note 7 or S7 edge even though Im not sure I the edge variant actually makes sense for me .,0
851,If this is truly it bye bye my note 4 .,0
852,Its really difficult to protect with a casescreen protector,0
855,Plus it is more likely to break than a flat screen .,0
856,I too am wondering this .,0
857,These images make me happy .,1
858,Holy hell I want it .,0
859,No Edge Screen looks like its going to be bigger than 5.7 Inch and if the rummors are true IP68 Retina scanner Front flash ... .,0
861,Cant wait to change my S6 .,0
864,I go through gt200 of a full charge almost every day.But I really want IP68 .,0
865,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 leaked rendershttps note 6 or 7 here s our best look yet at samsung s edgy phablet gtHemmerstoffer also noted that unlikely that there will be a non edge variant of the Galaxy Note 7 If they brought it back with the s7 I dont see why the powerhouse note wouldnt get it back .,0
866,They knew they messed up taking it away in the first place gtThe curved side only makes me love my Note 5 even more .,0
868,It will make screen protectors impossible to use .,0
869,Just a stupid decision in my opinion.There are a significant number of people who dont use screen protectors or cases and do just fine .,0
870,Welp looks like Ill be leaving Samsung by the time I can upgrade from the S6 .,0
871,I was planning on hoping with the next note but Im not a fan of the edge display at all .,0
872,And judging by the way theyre going the S series is likely to not have a non edge device by the 8th generation .,0
874,Looks pretty cool .,1
875,Was hoping for an edge variant but I wont mind the curves since I already have the s7e .,0
876,But dat alleged 4200 mAh battery doe .,0
877,Will definatly be the biggest battery phone I ever had .,1
878,Yes you apparently slept right thru the whole rumors release and year .,1
879,Lol Samsung wants to get the Note and Galaxy lines on the same numbering system so GS7 and Note 7 will be the same generation of phone .,0
881,If there is no non edge variant Im going to be at a loss as to what to replace my 4 with .,0
882,Word is a new gear vr is going to be released with this phone using USB c and having updated features .,0
883,Having the s7 edge I wouldnt want that double edge on a bigger phone .,1
884,The curved portion is quite sensitive and I imagine the stretch to reach on a bigger screen will lead to more accidental inputs .,0
887,The only reason Im not hating Samsung after owning my Note 4 is because it has replaceable battery .,0
888,There is no way I trust a Samsung phone without one .,0
889,Ill keep the Note 4 for another year .,1
890,I dont see much upgrades in the new phones .,1
893,Injustice is largely irrelevant relatively speaking being such an old gameseries .,0
895,Black and red would be sick Aww man I shouldve waited to get my S7 Is this coming to the US at all .,0
896,Any word if the Gifts of the Season bundle promotion is still going on .,0
897,You can still apply for it on the website but in the terms and conditions it still says only good through November 22nd .,0
899,Either way I got my Samsung Pay 200 gift code .,0
900,Just wondering if I should tailor my purchases using that based on if I can get the bundle promotion .,0
901,I believe you can only check on the status of the gifts of the season promotion .,1
902,You go to samsungpromotions.com click on that promotion enter your email and click check status .,0
903,My status was pending and randomly received it today .,1

920,3600 mAh from what the rumors are saying Curious theres no pics of the bottom .,0
922,Id like to see what the stylus bay looks like No stylus .,0
923,Theyre skipping past 6 straight to 7 .,0
924,Keeps it in line with their Galaxy S models which I believe is why they are doing it .,0
926,No one wants your shit satellite tv service Pics shows Galaxy Note 7 will have impressive design and looks .,0
929,More disadvantages than anything else Lm n I love the edge display but hate that there will never be a good screen protector for it .,0

951,It should recognize automatically that you bought something and itll have a button that says Claim your gift card .,0
952,Each Samsung Pay promo is to encourage someone brand new to add and start using the feature so technically yes to your question but if you keep waiting on future promos then youll keep missing out on the current ones .,0

966,Samsung is gon na need to fix this problem and really blow the next gen out of the waternot literally .,0
967,They need to prove to customers that this issue is solved and prepare for Apple with whatever they may have planned for a 10 yr anniversary .,0
970,g as they dont make another time bomb device .,0
972,Samsung is doomed if they couldn t rectify their mistake and S8 also starts to catch fire This is exactly what Im thinking .,0

1008,Damn are you that bitter of an Apple fan to post these articles and openly talk shit on people with Samsung phones .,0
1013,It was amazing .,1
1014,Like with most if not all phones anything is possible .,0
1015,It may not happen quickly but it will assuredly happen eventually .,1
1016,Excellent pre review Yes and now of the much cheaper new phones are coming up with 6 GB ram .,0
1017,But Samsung is starting to pull a Apple to some extent .,1
1018,The Samsung of old refused to be out speced The new Samsung S6 onwards seems to focus on UX and refining of hardware and software.Samsung still has very good specs but they dont seem to throw in stuff just for the specs it seems.The old Samsung would have produced a Note 7 that had 4000 4500 mah battery snapdragon 821 20 mp camera 6 GB Ram etc but with horrible UI that lags ugly looking hardware etc. .,0
1019,None the less it may be similar to the S7 Well Most notes have been similar to their counterpart in the S series it seems like .,0
1020,Either way Wasnt a fan of the S6 Freezes to much I miss my Note 3 and the stylist Hope this model is much better Great for movie watching while in the field .,1
1021,I used to treat my Note pen as a stylus .,1
1022,Then when I figured out the other functions and used them better its like the song in Aladin A Whole New World was singing in my head .,0
1023,My Note using lifestyle has never been the same since that moment .,0
1025,Dont discount the iris scanner .,0
1026,Gimmicky for average Joe consumer ... But in the enterprise and byod space ... Could be game changer .,0
1027,Still salty .,1
1030,Ive never had a Note before but the more I read about the S Pen the more it seems incredibly usefulconvenient.Sure I was hoping for a 4200mah or 4000mah battery as the earlier leaks indicated or even 3600 for that matter but 3500mah will still be the biggest battery Ive ever had in a phone coming from an S5 and is still an upgrade from the Note 5 which is really what it should be getting compared to .,0
1031,2.8 smaller than the S7E doesnt seem like a dealbreaker to me anymore.And lets all remember these are all rumors .,0
1032,Well know some cold hard facts in the morning .,0
1033,So I dont want to be complaining about everything thats possible to complain about .,0
1034,The Galaxy Note 7 seems like an amazing phone ... .,1
1035,As the Galaxy S7 wasBut am I the only one really deceived and unimpressed that they release it with cpu snapdragon 820 at this time for america .,0
1036,Like ... .,1
1037,all phones since beginning of year have that CPU and some phones from smaller companies are already announced with Snapdragon 821Higher clockrate and latest version to be released in August ... So except if I got this wrong and that its indeed the snapdragon 821 or that theres a way here in Canada to get the Exynos version I think Imma just wait and grab the next Nexus instead ... What are your thoughts on this .,0
1039,I was able to use a demo note at verizon for about a half hour the other day and am sold for that reason .,0
1040,Being able to annotate things and all of the functionality it has is very useful even for the short time I had used it .,0
1041,Sold on the note I am now an ex iPhone user ... Why is that Note specific .,0
1042,gtThis phone will be 5 months older than the S7S7E with virtually identical specsIm confused why you said this the Note7 is coming out five months after the S7 ... .,0
1043,Im in the minority with you .,1
1044,I hate the stylus entirely .,0
1045,I just dont need or care about it .,0
1047,I only get the note for the size.If theyd make an S8 large I wouldnt need to buy note anymore .,0
1048,Considering the Note 7 edge display I have to pray for S8 large edition I guess .,0
1050,Wait 2 days before judging when we have concrete facts Then its not for you .,0
1051,The spen isnt gimmicky its actually really useful .,0
1053,I jumped from the Note 3 to the S6 Active and miss the crap out of it .,0
1057,The biggest drawback is no IR blaster .,0
1058,The Note 4 finger print scanner was a gimmick .,0
1059,They fixed it after that with the S6 and the Note 5 works just as good as the iPhone .,1
1060,Wireless charging though ... I literally never plug my s7e in What do you know about its specs .,0
1061,can you put the S pen in backwards .,1
1065,One with 4 and 3500 and s7e stuff and one with 6 4000 and really powerful specs so like one could be for power users and one could be for productivity because they just want the s pen I currently have the S7 Edge and that pen on the Note 7 makes me wet man .,1
1066,I guess Ill skip the note 7 .,0
1067,Best Buy has not seen them .,1
1070,People that are looking at this as just a phone miss the point of the Note series entirely .,0
1071,The Note phones have no real competition to users that have adopted the S Pen .,0

1252,Uninstalled all Gear VR related apps Oculus and Samsung VR related apps and phone is back to normal.But man that created some annoyance for the day ... Pretty sure it had nothing to do with which carrier version you have it seems to be that app update related .,0
1254,So totally weird but Samsung recently pushed some updates and now my phone is acting super sluggish apps are not running properly .,0
1255,Battery is draining very quickly and the phone is running very hot .,0
1256,Everything is just acting whacky .,0
1257,Youtube playback keeps stopping buttons not working right .,0
1260,Is it just me or is the American Snapdragon variant more prone to overheats in comparison to the Exynos version .,0
1262,Also not receiving texts cant use Samsung Smart Switch to back it up and cant unencrypt my SD card .,0
1265,Same it was fine the day before i took mine off ultra powersaving mode and it was pretty warm on sleep mode only ... Im having this battery issue as well .,0
1266,Woke up this morning and used 50 of battery in the span of an hour or so .,0
1267,I am using the same case on my S7 and have recently started having battery issues .,0
1268,I cant seem to find any helpful info online .,0
1272,Because Im seriously asking I dont have that app installed and Im having the same issues .,0
1274,The pop up chat head on messenger isnt working properly and my texts arent sending correctly i use the VZW message app Im on tmobile I think Google fubared something .,0
1275,If you try and uninstall apps or install new ones they will get stuck in downloading or uninstalling.I tried clearing the downloader and play store data but lost my list of apps ths eye recently intakes .,0
1276,Anyone have a list of apps recently updated from the play store .,0
1278,You dont make any sense the one good thing about the exploding batteries is that samsung is gon na have to wow everyone with their next iterations of their flagships to get people back on board and forget about the mishap .,0
1279,Just make a solid phone that does not blow up Samsung .,1
1281,That doesnt really matter if the VR functions are going to completely overheat the phone .,0
1283,Plug phone into Chromebook and play it .,1
1284,Only question I have is where is the curved back .,0
1285,A flat version would be awsome but it should still have the curved back I really do hope this isnt a prototype but What about those light reflections near the home button next to the capacitive Android buttons .,0
1287,There is no flat version mate .,0
1288,Im sorry \ Theyve already filed with the FCC and released the preliminary specs to retailers ahead of launch so they can get cases and accessories ready in time.Maybe grab the note 5 instead Damn i saw demo of it on a samsung store I hope i had the money to buy it now .,0
1290,i am using s6 and its battery sucks big time Best display and best camera right now Holding out for a rumored phone will leave you waiting forever They probably order the ad to be up on the launch day and the billboard company made sure it was there on time by putting it up the evening before or so .,1
1296,Then the TSA could seize it at a port of entry ... So you know .,0
1297,I would call it the Ford Pinto of phones My theory with the note 7 and apple 7 is that the phones have no way to cool down since theyre so air tight in order to be water proof ... maybe thats helping things overheat to the point that they just start to fail and poof .,0
1298,Man ... Anyone know when the LG v20 is coming out .,0
1300,Everything about the 7 is so much better than the note 4 .,1
1301,Im absolutely gutted .,1
1302,Even with two recalls Id argue the note 7 to still be the best phone released this year .,1
1305,In my line of work when entering oil terminals they ask to see if I have a Samsung phone regardless of what version it is .,0
1306,Youre better off biting the bullet and downgrading although its just an upgrade because youll actually be allowed to travel with your phone .,0
1308,I feel like I want to keep it until at least Spring when the new generation of phones come out .,1
1309,Im back on my Note 3 too and mourning the loss of my stupid sexy Note 7 .,0
1310,My colleague has an S7 Edge that Ive been fondling and its close enough to the Note 7 that Ill temporarily upgrade to one .,0
1311,After that Ill get whatever the next stylus phone is that Samsung releases later next year .,0
1313,Im able to return it for a 100 refund .,1
1314,I had the Note 2 and Note 3 for years with no issue .,0
1315,The only harm I have had from this is the frustration of having to return the phone twice .,0
1316,Im sure that in two years they will have either fixed their issues or completely imploded .,0
1317,Knowing Samsung as a company I will bet that they will have fixed their issues .,1
1318,If you dont feel confident in them to purchase a Samsung product again I completely understand but I have found that outside of this incident their quality has been unsurpassed .,0
1319,Then again maybe the Pixel will win me over .,1
1320,I also gave up my Note 7 today .,0
1321,I recommend the S7 Edge in an upgrade program like T mobile Jump On Demand .,1
1323,Now theyre laughing all the way to the bank .,1
1324,I could have ended up with one of these phones if they released a flat version its super lucky they insisted on the damn curved screen or Id be an owner .,0

1329,That table is not the table he used .,0
1330,T mobile Im pretty sure And its a good thing I have an extra phone that I didnt get rid of .,1
1331,Yeah this is the thing .,1
1334,Although OPs answers are pretty vague so its difficult to tell what the actual situation was if theres any chance that it was not plugged in not charging not fresh off a charge and it just randomly exploded in his hand .,0
1335,Then it is a much bigger more scary situation than i had been led to believe ... Any more Info or a source on that .,0
1336,Im not entirely sure but Id put my money on before any official statement by Samsung If you know your phone has a chance of over heating and exploding and you still want to use it before recall then common sense says dont put a case on it .,0
1339,Never done it but why do you have to remove the bands .,0
1340,Haha I get it .,0
1342,I really dont recommend this .,1
1343,It seemed to work for short periods.I left it to charge overnight and it was extremely hot and would turn on .,0
1345,I see a wire in that picture .,1
1346,Yep I can charge both my watches Moto 360 1st and 2nd gens on it in a pinch .,0
1347,It doesnt look like it .,1

1356,holy fuck this doesnt make anything better for Samsung .,0
1358,If its not a note 7 its been tampered with .,0
1359,I guarantee it .,1
1360,If its confirmed that its a stock battery its almost worse though because it shows theyre having issues with more than one model of phone .,0
1361,Its very likely it was a 3rd party battery though .,0
1363,gt Non insurance repair involves replacing the deviceAre you sure about this .,0
1364,My friend cracked his S7 Edge a few months back and Samsung replaced the screen on his device and gave him back the exact same phone he already had .,0
1365,how much was your premium.how much is your deductable .,0
1367,This is a new low even for Samsung customer service.What a total fiasco this company .,0
1369,gt When I pressed them they wouldnt give me a time frame .,0
1370,And you think the Note7 fiasco will be over in a few weeks .,0
1371,How long is reasonable for me to wait with a broken phone .,0
1372,Screen breakage isnt covered under warranty ... so 0 months When they repaired my S7E they indicated that the screen and bezel edge frame is one unit .,0
1373,Not only that but the screen is fully curved at the sides unlike any other phone that i know of which carries its own premium in labor and the manufacturing process used to make it .,0
1374,They must be real careless.Dropped my S6E a few times already once even from about 1.2 m above the ground.No cracks at all only minor dents around the aluminium edges thats hardly noticeable.I dont have a case or screen protector but either way you got to learn how to grip and take care of your phone.Like if I am bringing my phone along for running I make damn well sure that my pants pocket is deep and not shallow otherwise the phone can drop out of the pocket easily .,0
1375,S7E is gon na be about 350 400 bucks as somebody in the repair industry unless theyre using knock off non OEM parts .,0
1376,Also you guys should change up your procedure for Water Damaged phones I have gotten 4 people coming to me after taking it to you guys first because apparently all you do is put it in a humid controlled heat box for a given amount of time o.o exactly ... hopefully this really will be a temporary situation ... I suspect that they dont actually fix your phone they just replace it with a new one and recycle the components from the old phone into a refurbished one and maybe they are low on S7e with the Note7 mess ... I dont know ... I just cant believe theyd take this approach ... its like they want their stock to crash even further Just a note the user youre responding to wont know that youve replied because you posted a parent level comment as opposed to reply to the existing comment .,0

1378,Too bad theres no way to keep them from doing it .,0
1379,I got my wife one about a month ago and 15 minutes out of the box my four year old son knocked it off of the counter and cracked the edge of the screen .,0
1380,We hadnt even activated it yet.Ive been checking a few times a week and get this same response each time .,0
1381,Extremely frustrating .,0
1382,Got my screen replaced same day at the Samsung depot in Montreal a week ago they had it for just under 3 hours .,0
1391,Im guessing they purchased via ATT financing and denied ATT protection .,0
1392,So thats a no go .,0
1393,Im not sure if the S7E is the same but my S7 I can put a 200GB microSD card nanoSD .,0

1408,It is 1 mistake car manufacturers have a recall left and right .,0
1409,My Dodge Avenger and friends Kia are currently in a recall .,1
1410,I plan on getting the Note 8 but like every other phone I always get it a couple months after the release .,1
1411,As supported by the Note 7 that I thankfully avoided dealing with that headache it seems .,0
1412,I love the Note phones my life has been much easier with the Note phones and I cant see myself with other phones than the Note .,1
1413,I tried I really did guys but I hate any phone without a stylus .,0
1415,Of course the brand is damaged its definitely not pre exploding loyalty .,0
1417,Im a T mobile rep and I believe it did hurt the Samsung brand a bit .,0
1418,Most of the time I recommend an S7 or S7E customers ask me if thats the exploding phone .,0
1420,As a Samsung fan it does kind of annoy me since people arent aware of how good these devices are .,1
1421,These reviews are just bullshitt a month ago they were like only 30 Note7 Owners would buy a samsung device again .,0
1422,... okay .,1
1425,Probably 3rd party repairers .,0
1426,They do void warranty though.There might be damage to the front glassLCD .,0
1427,For them at least in Aus they require all physical damage to be paid for to re instate warranty .,0
1428,If Samsung Singapore is any similar to Samsung Australia in terms of warranty requirements that might be the reason for the cost .,0

1441,gt The company is counting on the Galaxy S8 to help revive smartphone momentum after the discontinuation of fire prone Galaxy Note 7s .,0
1442,Samsung did not comment on what types of services would be offered through the AI assistant that will be launched on the Galaxy S8 which is expected to go on sale early next year.Pretty much You mean the Google assistant .,0
1443,Its not bad but Siri is a lot better however the new Nougat one that Google made is apparently on par and much better than Siri .,0
1444,I use my Google all the time but there are just some things Siri does better when we used both to see .,0
1445,Looks like Samsung is trying to re VIV their sales .,0
1446,Its up now Looks like it only applies to top loading washers and thankfully mine is front loading .,0

1459,Its the HDR video thats impressive .,1
1461,This may come in use then Moving data is easy with Samsung Smart Switch yep same thing .,0
1463,what is mobile hdr why samsung s note 7 screen is a window into high dynamic range s future That back looks weird .,0
1466,They dont give the final product to testers incase they are lost or stolen Im fairly certain this is a non edge prototype rather than the final one .,0
1467,Especially when you have a look at the charging port on the bottom Im pretty sure a definite USB type c charger would have a USB c shaped port not micro USB with USB c behind .,0

1485,I was literally just coming to market for a S7 edge and this pops up will be picking one of these up for sure All they need to do now is to have a good purchase plan and protection plans and this is how smartphones should be sold .,0
1486,Good going Samsung .,1
1487,I have the non edge variant available here in the chicagoland best buys Who is better than Samsung at updates besides the Nexus phones .,0

1498,Id rather watch nonstop ads than that .,0
1499,This is good to know .,1
1500,Its sad to see that a tech company would to allow themselves to interfere with the user experience in such an intrusive way .,0
1502,Smart TVs just sound like a hindrance when I can so easily replicate and surpass the experience offered by Smart TVs by simply buying a substantially cheaper high resolution non Smart TV and slapping a Chromecast on it.On a side note I find it funny that the site hosting this article employs some pretty annoying and intrusive ads as well .,0
1503,Yes because anyone realistically read through the 48 pages of terms and conditions and however many pages of the privacy policy on the tiny box they have on the screen .,1
1504,Just buy a Chromecast or Roku thank you .,0
1505,Nice .,1
1506,Are these ads subsidizing the real price or did Samsung decide to slap ads on top of a full price purchase.This is horseshit .,0
1509,But Id still watch the video anyway I was surprised it still worked .,0
1511,I have Spotify on my 2013 Samsung Smart TV Oculus app fucked up .,0
1512,A hotfix has been released but you have to open oculus to install it .,0
1513,Do that and restart your phone to be safe then check your battery drain For me it is the Samsung Gear VR app draining battery like crazy 36 in 2h .,0
1514,I have no idea what to do cant deactivate it and cant uninstall it You know ... Oculus did update just the other day .,0
1516,But 1 the drop was inside and on a wood floor phone in case landed screen down and 2 pretty sure drops like this should not affect the battery .,0

1526,This is an awful issue that not a lot of people are going to understand whats going on .,0
1527,I actually had a problem yesterday with receiving texts hours late .,0
1528,Like 8 hours late but time stamped from the original time .,0
1529,Weird .,0
1530,Glad I found this .,1
1531,My phone has been dying within three hours and was so warm it was insane .,0
1532,Will try this and see if it works .,1
1533,Honestly had the same exact same thoughts .,0
1534,Was really concerned that the phone itself or the battery was having some issue and I was going to need either a new model or to change devices .,0
1535,Ill try to uninstall the Oculus app and see if that works .,0
1536,Uninstall oculus worked to fix battery drain issue .,0
1537,Not sure if its related but my keyboard keeps hiding while Im in the middleof typing ... anyone else having this issue .,0

1544,I uninstalled it but I guess I didnt have to .,0
1545,Im in Idaho and went in to my local Best Buy to see about the exchange .,0
1546,The Best Buy rep told me that they have Note 7s in stock but are waiting for Samsung to unlock them .,0
1547,I was able to preorder one and will receive an email when mine is available .,1
1548,He said most likely it would be around the 21st of September .,1
1551,First one my store has done .,1
1553,So happy to have it back .,1
1555,Only for customers who already purchased Sprints online chat is useless .,0
1557,I contacted them through facebook .,0
1562,Compared with previous Galaxy Note phones in my opinion this is a straight upgrade in every aspect thats important to me.Compared with all other phones on the market there are some positive and negative comparisons but for my own personal use its the best phone currently manufactured .,0
1563,Just remember to disable iMessages before you switch or you might miss a bunch of messages from friends and family that theyre trying to send to you .,0
1564,Its supposedly annoying to fix if you do it after youve already switched .,0
1565,The 4 hours screen on time kinda sucks for such a big battery ... doesnt the s7 edge get like 9 hours like my ip6 s plus with its 8 12 hours sot Someone posted a reviewer getting 4.5 sot max brightness the whole time .,0
1567,So battery is upper level for sure .,1
1568,Nobody would know how the iPhone 7 would sound or if it would have better speakers because it hasnt even been announced yet .,0
1570,No more rumors TVs need to last longer .,0
1573,This is because USB C cables are reversible .,0
1574,EDIT The ridges are to help identify which side of the USB cable is up so that you can essentially plug in the micro USB cable into your phone without much effort .,0
1575,As USB C cables can go in either way the design of the ridges are no longer needed .,0
1576,Would look pretty weird with ridges on both sides and having it on one side would habituate people into plugging in USB C cables only one way .,0
1577,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag.On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you _ may _ have the USB 3 speeds.On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere .,0
1578,And none of those will work on the new phone.However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new.Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C.Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier .,0
1579,Fine by me as long as it has wireless charging .,0
1581,Headphones xbox one controller etc etc So I really only have one cord and that is what came in the box .,0
1583,Feels snappier ... This is the best tldr I could make original location data police warrants reduced by 95 .,0
1584,Im a botgt Police routinely request location data from phone companies but the result is determined on the basis of the nearest cell tower which typically only provides a general estimate of a phone location.gt The better Google data is the more its ads are worth a strong incentive for continuing to collect and store exact location data.gt On the basis that Google ampquotCollects and retains location data from Android enabled mobile devicesampquot police requested all the location data between the phone activation and the date of Flowersamp039 arrest.So there is no monthly cost to be part of this program.Link to said program .,0

1588,troy a great device .,1
1589,I own an unlocked Note 5 n920c version running stock marshmallow and a Galaxy S7 through ATT .,0
1590,My Note 5 runs as good if not better than my ATT S7 edge just because my unlocked Note 5 isnt loaded with crap software that ATT has removed features from while adding stupid apps I dont want .,0
1591,Similar to Apple Samsung introduced the Galaxy Club upgrade program with the launch of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge .,0
1592,Samsung has just told a Reuters reporter that one in three S7 customers in South Korea have chosen to join the upgrade program .,0
1594,I dont think its a huge ripoff considering it comes with their apple care plan .,0
1595,If samsung brought out the same shit here in the US Id jump on it asap The 12 Mpix camera was a surprise .,0
1597,I just did some research yesterday there seems to be no updated news on this .,0
1598,I have a gear s2 as well and I want to be able to use my fancy watch and what not .,1
1599,This is the best tldr I could make originalhttp Samsung is sweetening the deal for early adopters with a free Gear VR offer with purchase of either S7 running February 23rd through March 18th .,0

1607,They are slowly winning me over to buying one .,1
1608,Im holding out til the Note 8 because lets be honest every other phone looks like a major disappointment except the s7 .,0
1609,The only reason I wouldnt buy it is because I doubt ill ever use a screen size greater than 5.5 apart from that what happened to the Note 7 was very unfortunate and could have happened to any company .,0
1610,According to the following there is nothing to say that the Note 8 wont be coming I think someone found out that the anode and cathode within the battery would somehow short out creating heat and then causing the explosion .,0
1611,Note will never be the same after the Note7 fiasco.My prediction is the Note8 will do so bad that Samsung will drop the Note name for the next phone.Note exploding phones at this point Posting from my Note 3 which I had to resuscitate after returning my Note 7 finally yesterday .,0
1612,It took the FAA ban to force me to return my beloved N7 .,1
1613,Ill wait for the N8 and in the meantime getting a LG V20 deleted Im hoping theyll come back with something worthy of the note title .,0
1616,See this tweetfrom TMo CEO Safe to assume others will follow it begins rimshot This would be huge for tizen .,0
1617,It will tell you when your battery will explode .,1
1618,Google is not going to share the Google Assistant with Samsung .,0
1619,It will only be available on Google branded phones Maybe theyll kill the retarded Samsung voice assistant .,0
1620,The thing is just pathetic and fails to interpret the right words most of the time .,0
1621,Another step closer from Samsung breaking away from AndroidGoogle My wife is gon na keep hers but Im ready to jump to the v20 or pixel ... hopefully my note doesnt blow before the other two are out .,0
1622,Let yall beta test for me lol come on dude .,0
1623,dont stoop to this level Man .,0
1625,WTF.Why cant they fix THIS CRAP ALREADY ... .,0
1626,I really want to love these phones but damn .,1
1627,samsung probably just received a massive order from ISIS .,1
1628,not all bad news ... chin up s Just keep exchanging it for a new phone and getting the freebie promotions .,0
1630,At this point I hope they do no one will allow you to return or exchange your device if you accepted a replacement .,1
1631,A recall is the only way to recover my losses on this phone .,0
1632,I will say it again a flagship phone that cant be used on a plane is no true flagship and is not what I paid for .,0
1633,Not as sick as Samsung executives .,0
1634,I am also upset by it because I have a replacement Note 7 replacements cant be returned or exchanged and now I am most likely never going to be able to use it on a plane the resale value will be shot and it may start on fire .,0
1635,I am now stuck with this .,0
1637,I guess the phone is too good to be unexplody I expect the government to be all over this because they certified that the new devices were safe if it turns out that they are unsafe they are not going to risk looking stupid again .,0
1638,There have been claims of all types of phones exploding over the past few years but the Note 7 has gotten a ton of flack for it .,0
1639,I have a hard time believing a replacement phone has blown up .,0
1640,Until Samsung comments Ill just pretend this is on a magazine cover by the checkout line at Walmart .,0
1641,There was an iPhone 7 that exploded .,0
1645,If no other Note 7 explodes it may be someone purposely caused the explosion .,0
1647,stock plunges .,0
1648,people no longer buy samsung products since they are like carrying bombs in your pockets .,0
1649,These phones are suddenly becoming insanely popular in muslim countries .,1
1651,This is a new note 7 I got the update on my exchange note 7 as well .,1
1652,Over night this morning I had the successfully updated message .,0
1657,I kind of like it though .,1
1658,I dont see why it would arrive on phones without battery problems .,0
1659,Whatever I remember using it and being very confused as to what actual purpose it serves .,0
1661,Bout time I loved the UI but the song selection was ho hum or maybe I was just unlucky .,0
1662,I usually get great songs in Pandora and Spotify is great too .,1
1663,Samsung and Slacker just couldnt keep up with the competition to keep milk music going .,1
1664,looked cool but was a C.F. Search on the net for official Samsung Galaxy Note 7 promo videos there are plenty of them .,0
1666,The first line of the article literally mentions that this is directly related to Brexit .,0
1667,Itll be interesting to see what happens when the UK government starts giving companies special deals unhindered by EU restrictions .,1
1668,I do not support this decision .,0
1669,I doubt they will release an edge variant without the normal flat version .,0
1670,Their edge models havent been as popular and it would be foreseeable mistake .,0
1671,TBH before I bought my Note 5 I was deciding really hard whether to get it or the s6e .,0
1672,one with the legendary spen and spen benefits or one with the sexy dual curves for looks and display effect .,1
1674,My understanding is they kinda have to they developed a certain chip with 3gb and improved it the easiest improvement was just doubling shit or something like thatHonestly 6gb would be nice at least theres little chance of memory issues .,1
1675,yes so the note series and S series can be on the same number Disappointing we will likely not have an option between edges or not but I guess its silly to make t,0
1678,Its hibting that this time there wont be a normal version and just a edge version Well that blows Im not one for curved screens at all .,0
1679,Cant wait for it ... Wonder what colours it will come in .,1
1680,If this is about the s7 I have one with smart stay off .,1
1681,No reports of crashing over here Reset app preferences Not having expandable storage makes it take a serious step down from perfect imo Its usually march No confirmation of that yet .,0
1682,So far just announcing it .,0
1685,Sure made me laugh .,1
1686,Damn a flip phone thats better than my 5c .,0
1687,Nice .,1
1689,Never mind .,0
1692,comment of the month right here Sounds like Trump .,1
1695,Their cloud storage is stupid .,0
1697,I Cloud is fully accessible from a pc .,1
1698,My gallary automatically synced to the samsung cloud backup and i have no idea how to remove them from there .,0
1702,Wait so you cant actually access the cloud files .,0
1703,So whats the fucking point .,0
1705,Another thing to disable .,0
1707,You can just search cloud and it will pop up .,0
1713,Btw did you murder the guy who knocked out your phone .,0
1714,lol Thats what I wan na hear .,0
1716,When I detached the phone from the mount I could write everywhere .,0
1719,During my search I found someone that said they had to get the phone replaced .,0
1721,It was disconcerting to see the pen not work over the magnetized area.It would be nice to know for sure .,0
1722,The magnet mount I was using was nice .,0
1723,It does it with the Note 5 as well .,1
1724,As soon as I take my case off though its completely fine Luckily I noticed this issue the first time I stuck it to the mount so I dont know about prolonged use.The fact that the S Pen doesnt work on the magnetized area was enough for me to pull it off and be done with it .,0
1725,The screen works as intended now .,1
1727,We need answers on this ASAP .,0
1728,I ordered the spigen wallet one and the flip has a magnet strap to keep the lid closed .,0
1730,Had my Note 4 on an iMagnet for 2 years and no damage .,0
1731,The metal plate did affect my nfc though .,0
1732,No it doesnt have the hardware for it to work MST .,0
1736,Still No USAA gt Grow Financial Federal Credit UnionI tried to add my card and failed.I called Grow Financial and they informed me it was not yet supported .,0
1737,14.99 plus an upfront payment of 250 plus a random monthly amount determined by the roll of a DampD die Still no Canada ... My credit union was added but I use big bank credit cards anyway .,0
1738,Honestly most of the people who complain about their banks not being supported should just get a credit card from a bank that is .,0
1739,I dont know if there are many people who realize the advantages of using credit cards over debit cards .,0
1741,It can take weeks or months to get your money back if someone fraudulently uses your debit card but one phone call reverses a fraudulent charge on a credit card .,0
1742,Still no regions Youre not missing much .,0
1743,Went around town a few days ago to try and use it so I could get the 30 gift certificate took 3 different stores until it actually worked .,0
1744,So embarrassing to fumble with your phone tell the cashier oh no it should work and then have it fail and have to fish out your wallet .,0
1745,Bank of England ... Nm Love the slider idea on the pictures .,0
1747,Huge difference Galaxy S7 Ftw .,0
1748,Those outdoor shots are great .,1
1749,Its a really bit of both from what I can tell .,1
1750,But the f1 .7 lens really comes into play as you can see more background details as compared to the iphone shots Go to a Samsung store and get them to flash off the carrier lock .,1
1753,Thanks this is incredibly helpful .,1
1754,Now I know what the problem is which the tech support couldnt even figure out I can address it better .,0
1755,Try emailing as well with the receipt and the box with the imei number attached .,1
1757,I still have the original product box and IMEI is the same .,0
1758,I dont know how it works but can Samsung change IMEI number.Anyway Ill try to contact them through social media .,0
1759,I cant agree more how bad their customer service is thanks .,0
1760,The S8 will be the bomb .,0
1761,Itll really bring the heat But the Note 7 already have this LightUp feature .,0
1762,LightUp means the cameras will shoot flames in two different directions lighting up the subjects in flames They might need to have a fire sale with the S8 .,0
1763,Garbage Ill wait to see if the trucks delivering it light up before I consider it .,0
1765,The S stands for safe ish I have a similar mark on my watch from contact with metal it hasnt come off in 4 yearsSo its not material transfer While hes wearing it but its gorilla glass right .,0
1766,use something softer than glass to scrape it off it looks like material transfer so i should come off with a little elbow grease Pencil eraser might work and not damage the screen .,0
1771,There is no reason why they should abandon them except for wanton greed .,0
1772,Stand by the product and keep customers .,1
1773,These watches are not inexpensive .,0
1774,I would probably buy the S5 once it comes around if the features are so much better .,0
1775,But if they fail to update the ware on my S2 I am going to think twice .,0
1776,Yeah ... I want the new one No wonder theyre giving away Fit2s Where from .,0
1779,They have a MO questions asked return policy if its returned within 2 weeks .,0
1780,Usually buy stuff there to try and return within the frame for money back .,0
1782,I bought a Moto 360 v2 and it got water damaged and they took it without a care Return it if its only 4 days old .,0
1783,Thats an invitation to the press conference on the 31st usually the launch date is weeks later .,0
1786,Probably going to pick one up on release .,1
1787,And you get data stash .,0
1788,I always have my 20 GB data full since I always have wifi available .,1
1789,They also offer free roaming in both Canada and Mexico which actually came in handy for me since I just had to go to a wedding in canadaland .,1
1790,... this is not the norm .,0
1791,If youre going with the note Id preorder to get in on that 256gb memory card .,0
1794,Meanwhile if you sign a 2 year contract I can get 550 off on the device for agreeing to stay with the carrier for 2 years .,0
1795,Since the device payment plan breaks it down over 24 months anyways isnt it beneficial to buy it under a 2 year contract .,0
1796,I honestly dont care if I get locked down for two years .,0
1797,unless hidden fees applyAlso I do know that T mobile has more perks but they dont have 2 year contracts .,0
1798,According to my logic above wouldnt it be beneficial to stay with VZW .,0
1799,Also my parents are with Verizon so we can get the 4 lines for 150 deal which is actually pretty sweet .,0
1800,My parents just hate the idea of having to leave a carrier theyve been with for 10 years .,0
1801,Coming from a GN5 I would LOVE the s pen but idk .,0
1805,But that 4x4MIMO is also very sexy .,1
1807,I would do the Note in all honesty .,0
1808,Its still an amazing phone .,1
1810,I have a striking feeling they may come up with a more advanced version with how they are currently in other countries .,1
1811,So the wait may be worth it but you need it now .,1
1812,If I were you I would figure out what I want and what the most important things are in a phone you want .,1
1814,I feel the Note 7 will offer more especially with the extra features it has .,1
1815,Plus if you make a habit out of using the pen you may grow addicted to using it .,0
1816,I forced myself to use it after not using it for a year .,0
1817,That whole year I feel like I missed out on its full potential and ever since I have never gone a day without using the pen .,0
1818,Its incredibly useful for what I do and I dont think I could be any more efficient with an S series phone than the Notes .,0
1819,Especially with how much they expanded on the pen features I am excited to get the N7 .,0
1820,S pen is awesome in using it right now to type this message .,1
1821,Browsing around with the pen is tight as hell too I dont know why you are being down voted either .,0
1822,I also hope that this one is black like the s7 is .,1
1823,I own an s6 edge and youre right its more of a dark blue which doesnt bother me but I would rather have a black phone.Id REALLY hoped for a flat model but I guess I dont mind this render .,0
1824,It looks as though the edges are toned down compared to the S7 edge .,0
1825,The s pen is going to be completely useless on the edges .,0
1827,They basically shrunk the screen usefulness size to make it pretty .,1
1829,This is really frustrating ... Now to see if all three colors are available at launch .,0
1830,Ah man I already got the gold App Optimization isnt a bad thing .,0
1832,Long press the notification and block it maybe Same discussion here Should hopefully be solved with the Marshmallow update you will then be able to disable notifications but keep the feature .,0
1833,Most comments are wrong .,0
1834,I am currently on a S6 with app opt but without the notification .,0
1836,It DOES work .,1
1837,Have this on my Galaxy Tab S2 and it is one of the most annoying things about the otherwise great tablet .,0
1838,That and Samsungs nagging suggestion to reboot the tablet every few days to help it run smooth ... really Samsung .,0
1842,You cant disable the notification without disabling the feature .,0
1846,I actually do .,1
1847,Some reason it just feels faster From what I can tell this is only available on Samsung devices running Marshmallow at the moment and the Lollipop version will be release in coming months .,0
1848,This app is incompatible with all of your devices .,1
1850,If you Like horror movies and scary games try sisters its only a small app but gave me a good few jumps .,0
1852,This reads like a Nigerian Prince who emailed me about money I have ... Wear it slightly lower it would add a slight discomfort for your nose but the quality of the vr goes up .,0
1853,The S2 Classic is surprisingly small .,1
1855,please post the watch face thanks looks real good I got a ceramic one and it looks fantastic .,1
1856,The ceramic matches the bezel .,1
1857,The lack of apps is definitely a negative but Im very tolerant of that .,0
1858,I usually buy a console at launch I bought the iPhone before apps even existed .,0
1861,deleted I put in my request for a refund through my employer account today .,0
1862,I wonder how theyre going to handle it since no one is shipping Note 7s anywhere right now .,0
1863,Im going to get a refund and order an iPhone 7 Plus .,0
1866,Love this always on display concept .,1
1868,whats the much awaited feature .,1
1869,any enhancements to AWD Note phones alway come with superior internals I thought the S7 edge had something similar .,1
1870,I enabled a feature a while ago that shows some of this that I enabled only for 12am to 7am .,0
1874,In the past 10 or so years we went from having 100 ish GB hard drives to having 100 GB or more SD cards .,0
1875,The only way you could get your hands on a proper camera was possible if you went ahead and bought a camera yet now phones takes better pictures and better video than some budget DSLR solutions .,0
1877,Standard on 80 of the builds back when DDR2 was the stuff and even when DDR3 came into the play there were still many PCs having 3GB of ram and now phones started having 6 GB of ram .,0
1879,Our phones surpassed both graphics wise and cpu wise what we had on the market for PCs 10 years ago ... .,1
1881,I cant believe my phone will have more ram than my laptop did 3 years ago .,0
1883,Oh and I still have my 250MB flash drive yes MB from middle school and I am only 22 years old so it wasnt that far off .,0
1897,CanonForbes website gave me cancer ... never going there again .,0
1898,I have insurance with a 200 deductible Just to add on you should do this ASAP .,0
1899,I did the same thing to my S6 and within a few days specks started appearing on my images .,0
1900,Im not sure if its tiny abrasions on the lens or dust getting underneath but I havent been able to get rid of it .,0
1901,It basically ruined the camera .,0
1903,I have no idea .,0
1904,I randomly found it yesterday .,1
1906,The lens is not shattered just the protective glass that part is probably like 92 cents .,0
1910,Its a bit of a pain to get the back panel off but replacing the lense is cheap and silly easy .,0
1911,Wouldnt be terribly unhappy with an edge display .,0
1912,Never owned a note edge so I would like to see how it worked with an s pen .,0
1913,For the VR its size right .,1
1916,Wouldnt be terribly unhappy with an edge display .,0
1917,Never owned a note edge so I would like to see how it worked with an s pen .,0
1918,I honestly dont understand why they would do it for the Note line .,1
1921,I dont see how having edges will add productivity especially if it makes it more difficult to navigate with the stylus .,0
1922,Project Valley like you promised a year ago of gtfo I enjoy the edge display .,1
1923,I pray this happens I want a 5.8 or 6 Note with an edge screen and stylus .,1
1924,I was actually disappointed the Note 5 didnt come with an Edge variant .,0
1926,Thanks Seriously .,1
1927,That sucks .,0
1930,There should be because these promotions that Samsung is doing seem to get better and better for buying the S7 or S7 Edge .,0
1931,I was jealous when Verizon had the free Gear S2 promotion and now Im REALLY bummed out that I didnt wait to buy my S7 Edge until this month .,0
1935,And have qualifying DirecTV or uverse TV subscription so is atampt sponsoring this promo or something .,0
1938,I got my Gear VR 2 days ago .,1
1941,n 5GB left on my phone .,0
1942,Turns out this is because of the position setting on the VR .,0
1943,Under the USB clip there is a black button .,0
1944,Press that and move the slider to position A and it centers everything back up again .,0
1946,But I also got my S7 edge already on march 4th Just got an email from Fedex havent placed a recent order for anything but the shippers name on the email says Time Warner by any chance did anyone get this email and it turned out to be the Oculus package Take a look at utelldeathnottoday post here they are offering a 100 credit instead of the VR .,0
1947,Normally I really prefer this but when I changed it it just felt weird to me .,0
1949,Making this change really takes advantage of the beautiful screen .,1
1950,So much better .,1
1951,Works on S6 also .,1
1952,Thank you so much for this tip .,1
1953,I found out how to do it without Nova launcher use this Find the activity that ends in displayscalingactivity Just 2 options normal and condensed .,0
1954,Give this man a medal .,1
1955,Dont worry that feeling goes away after a few sessions .,0
1957,I think your eyes and brain just have to adjust and then you are fine .,1
1959,So many cool things to do .,1
1960,Standing up using it is very disorienting so sitting down in a swivel chair works best IMO .,0
1962,Dremamine or another motion sickness aid might help Any idea if CPW or anyone else in the UK will get the silver edition .,0
1965,^ this be sure to sit in a 360 seat and avoid leaning forward or back .,0
1967,You should be sitting down for one .,0
1968,You also need to learn to look by turning your head instead of using your eyes to look around .,0
1971,Sweet another 9 months and well see it on ATampT .,1
1975,Ok Reports say they made their own watch and its better than South Koreas .,0
1976,Over 2 billion sold worldwide .,0
1977,Just switched to android in April so I am not going to iPhone .,0
1978,Best option for me is LG V20 .,1
1979,I didnt care for the s7e edges plus I want something different .,1
1981,I got the new Gear VR to go with my Note 7 so I REALLY dont want to swap away from Samsung .,0
1982,Im not a huge fan of the Edge but its the best I can do.Sigh .,1
1983,Sammy why have you betrayed us so .,1
1984,At first I was leaning Pixel XL but the early V20 reviews are lookin good .,1
1986,I really hope I dont have to give up my note 7 because its a great phone but if I do Ill go with one of those options .,1
1989,I hate the 32gb onboard storage doesnt cut it for me .,0
1990,id go for the iphone 7 for the better camera but that shitty locked os isnt for me Definitely a plus Im keeping my S5 until they release the S8 .,0
1991,Ive been thinking of the new iPhone but i have never tried iOS .,0
1992,Kind of scares me on spending 1000 euros on a phone with software I have never experienced .,0
1993,Not to mention a inferior phone imo .,0
1994,Thats kinda the boat Im in I was looking at getting the Note7 as my upgrade from my dinosaur phone but now ... Got ta start the search all over again .,0
1995,Hmmm do I dare not return my Note 7 .,0
1996,Yes that phone is very nice the 10 .,1
1998,Thats pretty depressing lol Probably Pixel XL or IPhone 7 plus Im leaning more towards the V20 .,0
2001,Ive never experienced it before nor do I really know what it is ... but I figure waiting it out until more in depth reviews are uploaded will help ease the whole exchanging process .,0
2002,Theres a guy that made a reply on the rAndroid forums here that got one from the NYC event .,0
2003,The big thing Im worried about is that the ZF2 was great until about three months in then a lot of people were complaining about poor build quality and slow UI etc. .,0
2004,Note 5 because I really miss the s pen .,0
2006,I loved my Note 7 and really dont wan na give it back .,0
2007,Verizon renewed my upgrade and is treating it as a new one so I figure worst case scenario if I dont like it I can return it and get a V20 .,0
2010,Why The Sony Selfie phone .,0
2011,P Ill put it on the list but its a bit meh for my taste .,0
2014,If you like Android go with Pixel XLIf you like iOS go with iPhone I rock the OnePlus 3 ... the phone is fantastic .,1
2015,Downsides are that it only works on T Mobile and ATT in US and the customer service from OnePlus leaves a lot to be desired .,0
2016,They seem to offer very fast shipping times in the US and the OS has very little to n bloatwear on it .,0
2017,Dash charging is incredible and really could change your phone charging habits ... 0 60 in 30 minutes or under .,0
2021,That is if you purchased it from your carrier and not directly from Samsung.com .,0
2022,Da FUK ... this is a total nightmare Not sure .,0
2023,Apparently people are not having any issues flying with their note 7s Just check posts further down rsamsung They just ask that you power the phone off.But I just wish samsung would figure something out .,0
2024,I am in the process of going back to my Note 4 for the time being waiting on a new SIM card since the old one was deactivated At this point I am wondering if I should just flat out return it and see what Google is going to release with the Pixel XL .,0
2025,If it sucks compared to the Note 7 I will re buy .,0
2026,When I called the Samsung number they told me no one is taking them because they dont want them on their trucks either .,0
2028,All return shipping of the Note 7s has been ceased at this time .,0
2029,OP I sell stuff for a living .,1
2031,If they refuse kindly tell them you will be doing a chargeback to your account and that they may pick up the device at X address .,0
2035,Well my phone stopped connecting to the internet and stopped making calls and ATampT said it was a software error .,0
2036,Thats what I reported to Samsung Yeah all this shit with the note 7 is crazy .,0
2037,Damn that sucks Wow User side software problems arent covered as theyre heavily influenced by user activity according to ATampT Dear friends.to help me.Please resent my letter to Samsung Camera plant or Samsung Quality Division .,0
2038,After 2 months of use camera is a defect .,0
2040,Its very bad for me .,0
2041,I enclose a photo examples .,0
2042,I guess it is a manufacturing defect photo module Samsung Isocell samsung galaxy s6s front facing camera.html.I ask you to assist in the elimination of this defect .,0
2043,In Belarus this photo module replacement is not provided .,0
2044,Seller and warranty shop in Belarus now ceased operations .,0
2045,Russian and many other states Samsung support supports are rejected my request .,0
2046,I ask you to help me with that problem.With best regards I had a totally different experience .,1
2047,Their customer service is really bad .,0
2048,My S6 straight up burns me and has recently stopped working at a very inconvenient time when I dont really have the money to replace it .,0
2049,I sent them an e mail detailing my long list of issues with my phone and I got a form response from a dude in India basically telling me too bad you bought your phone over a year ago .,0
2050,gt I would like to thank you for continuously selecting Samsung brand,0
2053,You are truly one of the most loyal cusotmer of our company and it has always been a sheer pleasure to serve you .,1
2054,The whole letter read like a parody of customer service .,0
2055,Sheer pleasure of serving me .,1
2057,Also the link to the are you satisfied survey naturally does not work in the e mail and there was no response .,0
2058,This whole thing has left me so jaded and depressed .,0
2059,Really really bad customer service .,0
2060,As another user pointed out this will probably be the last Samsung product I buy in a while .,0
2061,I literally dont want to support them anymore .,0
2063,rhailcorporate Given that a smaller battery is powering a bigger screen Im kinda tempted to just get the S7E and not wait for the Note .,0
2064,However I signed up so hard I cant wait for this release .,0
2068,I WONDER WHAT IT IS Why is this being down voted .,0
2070,I dont use a case at all for my s7 edge and I have no scratches after 2 months .,0
2072,I dont believe they make glass screen protectors for any of the curved screens yet .,0
2073,Yeah it is cheap plastic after all even though they look sleek .,0
2075,The case may just aggravate the issue of microparticles scratching .,0
2082,I have no scratches .,0
2084,Once some dust with quartz in it gets inside the case its constantly shoves and rubbed up against the glass .,0
2085,3 S7s in my household and no problems at all .,0
2086,Keep hearing about a scratched home button scratched screens and other problems .,0
2088,Well i did get the gifts of the season package too with the headphones a couple months ago .,0
2090,Ok probably sent on accident after the gifts of the season event .,0
2092,Either way didnt know i was getting it .,0
2094,Sorry reddit app didnt have it Still no Marshmallow on my nordic s6 .,0
2095,We all are buddy I was taken completely by surprise on this one .,0
2096,Given Sprints history I was convinced that we would never see Marshmallow .,0
2097,Only as a paper weight But will it blend .,0
2098,This is so metal it even bleeds .,1
2099,How I hate people that dont use protection .,0
2102,I felt sorry for it ... I would have given them my S6 in exchange for the 7 edge Marshmallow will add most if not all of the new edge features from the s7 edge which seem to add a lot more functionality Yep Im doing that all the time really frustrating .,0
2103,I dont use the edge features that much so yes S7 would have been better for me but still will stick with the edge because of the 3600 battery .,1
2104,Yes but its not too bad for me .,0
2105,I may get a case for it because of it .,0
2106,I have a normal s7 and hit icons using with one hand .,1
2108,lol Try the one handed mode on your phone makes the screen smaller but its pretty nice How .,1
2109,I have the Note Edge which is huge compared to the other edges and i dont have a problem .,0
2111,nvm waives pointer finger dikembe mutombo Ive had an s6 edge since it came out and Ive never had a problem with it .,0
2112,Im a little surprised to even hear people say they have been having a problem with it .,0
2113,Nice one .,1
2114,What case have you got .,1
2115,I had this issue when typing on the keyboard I would consistently delete letters or add letters until someone on reddit said you can resize the keyboard to make it shorter on each side and give a palm rest on each side PROTIP Hey .,0
2116,I am thinking about getting the 6p or samsung 7 edge .,0
2117,What do you think about their battery life and sound quality through ear phones these are important parts for me .,1
2119,Hope the rumor about the battery is correct This is a pre production prototype .,0
2120,Notice the Samsung logo is missing on the front .,0
2122,Ok that edge looks much better with the smaller bezels damn It looks cheap to me I really hope this is just a prototype .,0
2123,Fuck I feel bad about buying my note 5 now Apparently if there is one it should be together in the sim slot .,0
2124,So dual sim or 1 sim sd card slot .,0
2126,Nothing concrete of course till they announce .,0
2127,Mentioned before in other posts but Verizon literally told me to hold off on my upgrade until March .,0
2128,News and Samsung confirm S7 conference Feb 21 ... Verizon says Samsung was just in their store for an important something ... Gon na say S7 available in March .,0
2129,It looks like the design might be taking a Note 5S6 approach where the flat side of the phone is opposite between the two.That being said I cant say the thin frame all around the phone has much appeal .,0
2130,I like the previous design where it stays thin on the sides and larger on the top and bottom .,0
2131,Gives the curved glass side a nicer look instead of the bubble.Guess well see how it looks when officially presented though The next iteration of junk will soon be upon us .,0
2132,Still on my Note3 nearly 2 years .,1
2133,I dont see what is wrong with you people .,0
2134,Youre gon na be waiting for a while .,0
2137,samsung already came up with solution for it because they also getting revenue from ad services .,0
2138,thanks for the info but when it going to available on lollipop device .,1
2142,I want to switch to Firefox and use ublock but chrome syncs my passwords and stuff .,0
2143,Whered you get those .,1
2144,Haha I was careful about that its why I said Its like ... .,0
2147,I got the classic myself .,1
2148,Very easily actually it has a push release mechanism Is there a difference between the sport and the 3g version .,1
2151,I wouldve liked the design to be like the huawei watch with the tizen os and the diversity of android wear .,1
2152,Dont let this sway your decision Ive had mine since launch wear it every day to a job unloading trucks .,0
2153,Zero sign of ware .,0
2154,Well if it is like they did with the Note 4 it wouldnt be released until after the S8 gets released and the Note 8 is announced .,0
2156,You want to wait another 5 months for a replacement .,0
2157,Its worth the wait .,1
2158,Mine came today and I am in Love .,1
2160,This is the easiest way A little fed up with my iphone been through two in the past 1.5 years at no fault of my own .,0
2161,I also hated being so limited as far as customizing the UI and all that after building a PC I already took a step away from apple so I figured id go all the way.So happy with the switch You will get one big shock with that Verizon version .,0
2162,Start with ugly Verizon logo their bloat all over can be disabled modified firmware .,0
2163,Its unfortunate iOS converts cant experience a good Android experience without carrier intervention .,0
2164,Hate Samsung for not releasing unlocked US version at launch .,0
2165,I ordered mine through Samsung do you know if it comes with a Sim card or if I have to go to ATampT to get a new one .,0
2166,Ive heard this before but would i loose air command and all that .,0
2167,Such a great change Id highly recommend the switch .,1
2168,Herehttp www.samsung.comussmart switch is the samsung oneEdit Switched from UK to US one .,0
2169,Which do i do first Top comment and recommendation .,1
2170,Im do be with samsung watches after my last exprience .,0
2171,They are so nice .,1
2172,I wish I could afford one .,1
2175,e they were announced on 22nd Feb and available for purchase on 11th March .,0
2177,At least Danny Glover isnt to old for that shit Thats incorrect .,0
2178,Ive preordered at full price and received the two free gifts The interesting thing is that Best Buy asks a shipping address for the VR .,1
2179,I just ordered a phone unactivated for Verizon .,0
2180,It really seems to me like they might deliver the VR and not require filling out the promo information receipt at the Samsung site .,0
2183,If you get no resolution from the seller or the device is stolen file the complaint with Paypal .,0
2184,The last device I sold had a reactivation lock which I turned off and made damned sure I turned it off before I let it ship .,0
2185,The seller should have turned this off before selling this device .,0
2186,Willing and able ... .,1
2187,if they were selling a stolen phone which happens to be what this feature is trying to reduce they wont have the credentials .,0
2188,Please do not ever buy a USED smart phone off eBay to save headaches next time .,0
2189,The monetary savings is not worth the stress and time consumed in fixing the forthcoming troubles along with the purchase .,0
2192,It doesnt let me it says it has to be a MD5 or .,0
2194,And the ROM I downloaded is a .,0
2198,Its haunting .,1
2199,I feel the same seeing it all the time while working there ... I couldnt find the wallpaper itself but I found a phone case that matches .,1
2200,http www.coveroo.comholidaypcoveroo samsung s6 edge thinshieldugly sweater deer I know ... Pushed back to a vague 2016 now .,0
2201,Not that any of my banks work with it anyways ... Also fuck Canada .,0
2202,Samsung Sucks because even iVerge as people call it said it was an amazing device with potential .,1
2203,Samsung should make a better version of it but on Android wear .,0
2204,Adoption rate will be way higher .,1
2205,Yeah I dont get this new color ... If its released during the holiday sales Ill definitely buy it .,1
2206,Id prefer to wait till the S8 but I need my phone for work and my S4 is finally giving out .,0
2207,Because the S7 has been widely regarded as an explosive device .,0
2208,Do some research They arent really focused on this its just a new Color .,0
2209,Thats it right .,1
2210,That doesnt take a lot of work .,1
2211,That would mean that they would have to redesign the logic board and change manufacturing processes while they could do this with parts they have already manufactured Hopefully this means my S7 Edge is close to replicating what I miss from my Note .,0
2212,Looks great so far .,1
2213,I hope we arent waiting for Samsung to do all their customizing before the OTA becomes available though ... ALERT THE PRESSES This just in water is wet .,0
2215,This too shall past .,0
2216,Well no shit .,0
2217,64gb is the new min dont have an old phone you can use while u wait for it .,0
2218,Maybe coral blue note 7 before everything blew up Good news I would like to have it .,0
2219,Im rather surprised by this colors popularity even the Verizon sales rep at the store by me said he was surprised I was looking for a black onyx Note 7 instead of coral blue .,0
2220,This is good timing .,1
2222,Daughter grabbed the last black they had so I waited .,1
2223,Ill wait for blue now .,0
2225,My ex wife used to say the same thing I desperately need 64gb .,0
2226,Android doesnt play nice with microSDs much nowadays .,1
2227,Adoptable storage isnt exactly what it should be .,0
2228,64 and up is needed .,1
2229,Okay Im for sure trading in my Note7 Iris scanner on board .,0
2230,Looks wonderful but ... must ... wait for S8 ... Unlocked .,1
2232,Basically put they want to have 4K resolution for the Tab S3 and make sure everything works properly with the recent Batterygate on the Note 7 so thats the main reason for the delay I asked one of samsungs employer he is marketing incharge in middle east about it.he said we stopped it because of less selling ... Its not been delayed because it never existed .,0
2233,More useless clickbait .,0
2235,I have the same tablet with Lollipop.If you have an LTE version mines WiFi only ask your carriers .,0
2236,Yea Samsung is dumping stock in other companies to raise cash for all the Note 7 mess .,0
2237,Not surprising that they are slowing down at the moment .,0
2238,Few websites do that for no reason but eh its whatever .,0
2239,Samsung wants to add 4K for the Tab S3 and make sure the battery doesnt overheat so the delay is for additional testing I think you answered my question thank you .,0
2240,I also like the note 7 but I will be opting out and getting the iphone was your process that easy really .,0
2241,I have a loaner s6 already if they cant give me something else I just want my refund .,0
2242,Thats a good question .,1
2243,It first says point of sale so Id assume best buy .,0
2244,Technically yes but the likely hood of you getting one in the store is about the same rate as getting the note 7 back .,0
2245,Forgot about the bonus credit thing yeah they give you credit for exchanging with another Samsung however you dont have to if youre willing to forego the credit You have a Note 7 and an S7 Edge backup.I need your job .,0
2246,Keeping it until Samsung sends replacement .,1
2247,Love this phone .,1
2250,Keeping mine also I havent been able to get it to heat up .,0
2251,I play youtube music source for 6 7 hours during work and Ive been fine .,0
2252,Plus trading it back in and going back to my iphone is to much of a chore .,1
2255,Ill wait until I can swap this one for another Note 7 if that is ever an option .,0
2256,Otherwise I roll the dice with my current Note 7 .,0
2257,Its handled well so far .,1
2258,Yup havent had any official notice yet here in Australia .,0
2259,I spoke to a couple retailers about the issue and sales are just being quarantined here I was told we dont have any of the problem units .,0
2260,Im actually returning mine and will be waiting for the cheaper refurbished handsets to hit the market and just re purchase it.My phone gets hot though I have mine the only time I was a little worried was when the system updated today and the phone ran a little hot .,0
2261,Put it under a cold rinse and its running cool now.Thats literally the only time its run hotter than warm for me .,0
2262,Since I got my phone at launch its ran cool to warm every single time even when I was initially downloading and running dozens of apps for the first few days.Unfortunately my local T Mobile stores cant get it restocked enough though as they only got 40 units yesterday and ran out almost immediately .,1
2263,I might have to wait until Monday to get it replaced .,0
2264,I got mine on Thursday and still have it .,1
2265,I know I should return it just because I really dont want my house to burn down but I dont want another phone .,0
2267,I think Im gon na wait until I can go into an ATampT store and pick a new one up hopefully theres no deadline or something like that .,0
2269,I am on Verizon and just got the text from them saying I could return it etc. .,0
2271,So I am waiting until someone will just replace it .,0
2273,Mine works like a dream and thats with wireless charging about 80 of the times that I charge it .,1
2274,Pretty much no temperature change They can take mine from my cold dead hand .,0
2275,Theyll probably charge you if you send it back with a broken screen though .,0
2276,This is exactly what I plan to do except I traded in my S5 so I cant even fall back on it .,0
2282,That number was inaccurate because the actual reported number of cases was 35 which is 0.0014 .,0
2283,Basically a slim af chance that youll have an exploding battery but not impossible .,0
2286,Also cracked the screen the day I got it .,1
2287,But it works like a charm and Im keeping it until the replacements arrive .,1
2288,Also its nice that Im getting my cracked phone replaced for free .,0
2290,No issues or unusual warmth when charging .,0
2291,Still going to exchange but not until I can exchange for another note 7 .,0
2292,Until then I will be a little cautious just to be safe .,0
2293,Only charging the phone while Im around it to keep a eye on it and not charging it overnight while sleeping .,0
2294,Probably not necessary but with the fast charging its not really much of a pain .,0
2297,for example not leaving it on the charger while unattended and not charging next to my head while I sleep .,0
2298,Verizon Text came out today offering 25 off an accessory .,0
2300,Ahhh mine also went into a boot loop .,0
2301,I managed to get it through a factory reset but its junk now .,0
2302,Luckily I still have a few months left on my old S6 Edge contract so Ill be using that until exchange .,0
2304,Some file explorer app I downloaded did that also Did you download a GO app at some point .,0
2305,Its very old CMCleanMaster get that shit OFF OF YOUR PHONE That is definitely clean master .,1
2309,49999 for non euros I think it just depends on your hearing I have some partial hearing loss and it makes a difference for me .,0
2310,Surprised the 6P lasted that long Max brightness is unfair to lcd phones particularly iPhones because they are the brightest .,0
2311,The S7 on manual max brightness is around 400 nits compared to the 6s with around 600 nits .,0
2312,Im wondering if the Gear S3 will have this bio processor .,0
2313,Im going to be tempted to buy this for exercisesleep tracking and just use my Gear S2 for workgoing out .,0
2314,This is a new processor entirely so there will likely be some difference from the predecessors .,1
2316,That was a big deal breaker for me on the old one .,0
2317,I wonder if it will be water proof This is the future Youre a redditor .,0
2318,I dont need a detector to know you got body fat rtitlegore Do not let a celebrity walk away with it .,0
2319,I feel like the big size mixed with then making the phone thicker and curved on both sides should provide an excellent feel regardless of bumped size .,1
2321,Where I am I can only buy the 32 GB S7 .,0
2322,This means with the new phone I can never get fast performance past that 32 .,0
2324,After that answer Ill be slightly less unexcited .,0
2325,Im upset i even bought the wireless pad for my note 5 its more of a pain than its worth X Post referenced from rsamsungpay by ujbus Milestone Five million Samsung Pay users processed over half a billion dollars in the first six months showing a strong adoption rate in South Korea and the U.S.Amazon reviews on smaller capacity cases say it affect Samsung pay NFC and wireless charging So you want us the consumer to place 10000 mah worth of battery next to our head when making phone calls .,0
2326,Ill pass on third party stuff dont want explosion next to head or in pocket and wait for Samsung to deem its safe .,0
2327,Its also made in china ... Reminds me of my Motorola 7500 with high capacity battery ... Check zerolemon.comThey definitely have products for the S6 Edge .,1
2329,Expensive but worth it .,1
2332,Theyre marketed as the best of both worlds .,1
2333,Been wearing mine at the gym with no problem .,0
2334,The grooves on the rubber side mean its less sweaty than my old silicone strap How you finding the watch .,0
2335,Ive been struggling to decide between it and the Huawei watch thought Id post my watch with one of the Hirsch performance straps .,0
2337,They have the exterior look and feel of leather but are waterproof and breathe well due to the vents .,1
2338,Means I can wear the same strap to the gym in the shower or to work .,0
2339,Strap is rated for swimming if anyone feels brave enough .,0
2340,Yo whats up everybody its your boy Flosssssss back again with another videooo This guy says its 350 but I just waited outside next to best buy and robed the first guy that came out with it lol jk of course You might want to mention the issues with Verizon devices that can be bricked with attempts to gain access to the bootloader This work on s6e .,0
2344,Im gon na hold on and gather more info on these new replacement phones catching fire and in the mean time Ill continue to use my note .,0
2345,This phone is beautiful .,1
2346,Just spoke to Carphone Warehouse in the UK and theyre still waiting for update from Samsung regarding our options but said the phone is being discontinued altogether .,0
2347,I.e there wont be any more safe replacement note 7s .,0
2349,youll be fine with the iPhone 6 .,1
2350,iOS 10 brings some new life into older devices From where did you purchase the phone itself .,1
2351,On the link it appears as though and I may be entirely wrong so forgive me Samsung is refunding the accessories .,0
2352,When I return my Note 7 to Verizon I intend on bringing the receipts for accessories that I purchased at Best Buy to see if this is indeed the case .,0
2353,It may not be but it makes sense for Samsung to bear the burden of refunding accessories.Edit an earlier iteration of this link mentioned accessories .,0
2355,What a joke what an absolute joke .,0
2360,This will destroy the Note series I have never seen a tech disaster like this before .,0
2362,Good fuck it .,1
2364,Its ridiculously hard to get unlocked phones in Canada so they are probably more lenient due to that Just posted My s7 edge broke on a rug over concrete from 13 .,0
2367,Hope their engineering department reads these posts .,0
2368,The note 3 uses Gorilla Glass 3 which was essentially tank like on my nexus 6 For everyone shitting on Corning its not a weakness of Gorilla Glass 5 its a weakness of Samsung insisting that they curve the glass .,0
2369,Bending the glass makes it SO much weaker its not designed to be curved like that and Corning are not to blame Sorry to hear that the funny thing is i got this phone after insurance paid me for my broken galaxy s7 edge I cracked my N7 on day 2 .,0
2370,It fell from my hammock to dirt about 2 feet and cracked the front screen .,0
2372,It gets dropped weekly and has no issues R I P I dreamed I had a note 7 and cracked it .,0
2373,I broke three Note 5s in 72 days earlier this year .,0
2374,The first time it would have broke if it were made of diamond the second time was a toss up but the last time was a joke .,0
2375,It fell half a foot .,0
2376,Now I never had a case so I am not removing my responsibility but I drop my Galaxy S5 all the time sometimes majestically and it didnt break before or now .,0
2377,I love the Note and really want to get the 7 but is this still an issue .,1
2378,Gorilla glas isnt mroe solid IMHO .,1
2379,dropped my note 4 from 1.5 m on a tile floor which completly shattered the screen .,0
2381,I wasnt aware of such thing They are regular film protectors i just said glass protectors as in front and rear glass .,0
2384,t mobile.comaccessoriessamsung note7 zagg invisibleshield dry full body.htmlthose are the ones i picked up at the store when i picked up the phone They actually say 80 chance of survival from 1.6 m high which is head height .,0
2386,But yeah it seems its supposed to be more shatter resistant but more scratchable Oh man you do have me beat .,0
2387,lols I have a line on mine this is my first high end phone I dont know what to do the crack isnt noticeable unless put above white background and can barely be seen unless you look at it from an angle I can feel the crack tho its a thin line across the screen .,0
2389,Should I just buy a screen protector and put it on .,0
2391,If you cant do without or think you want all the new s pen features I say its worth it .,1
2392,Otherwise if you dont need a stylus go without .,0
2393,Does anyone know if the note 7 will have the same cooling as the s7 and s7 edge .,0
2394,Im thinking about getting it but I dont want to have overheating issues like the s6 since I do plan on getting the gear vr with it .,0
2395,There is nothing the S7 Edge can do that the Note 7 couldnt .,0
2397,Its really a question of if you use S Pen or not.There just isnt enough differentiating feature and I wouldnt even say the price is that big of a difference between the 2 phones .,0
2398,At least in the US the official unlocked version is 779 and Note 7 is 850 which is what the US unlocked version of Note 7 will cost once it releases in couple of months.What S7 edge costs 650 .,0
2400,Samsung pay dont work etc.So its definitely worth 70 to 100 actual price difference .,1
2402,Plus it still has some features the S7 doesnt have .,1
2404,It was great at writing quick notes easy place to have a quick screen grab and I just always used it for a multitude of things .,1
2405,I didnt use it a lot early on but I spent time with it and made it a habit to use and I realized that the s pen is much more than a regular stylus .,0
2406,It is a proper functionality feature that has a hell lot of potential for the Note .,1
2408,Feel in hand is second to none for me .,0
2410,I wouldnt say so.More rigid build due to higher quality aluminum Gorilla Glass 5 Improved screen 50 brighter at max HDR compatibility Vastly improved UX S Pen Iris scanner a gimmick for most people USB C USB 3.1 Slightly larger screen and dimensions 100mAh smaller battery Less curved display Significantly better in hand feel Is a s pen worth 200 to you It depends on your use case .,0
2412,If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge .,0
2413,Theyre both great phones it just depends on what feel is the most important part some more features or saving money .,1
2415,If you want the S Pen then there are enough other small improvements to make it worth the price.However if you dont like the S Pen then I dont think those small improvements are enough to justify 100 200 by themselves .,0
2416,Its not an easy decidion .,0
2417,Nonetheless do you prefer bigger phones .,1
2419,Easily worth the extra 200 .,1
2420,Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you can not get to the finger print scanner USB 3.1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features .,0
2421,I would pay more for anyone of those but to add them all together is a bargain for 200 .,0
2424,Thats ... Fast Please work like that please work like that please work like that .,1
2426,Infrared Via http playfuldroid.comsamsung galaxy note 7 starred in yet another videohttp www.sammobile.com20160721leaked video shows the galaxy note 7s iris scanner in action Seems like the same or very very close to the same speed as the fingerprint scanner which is good .,0
2427,If it wasnt that fast it would have been a huge mistake .,0
2428,Im now actually pretty impressed and excited to try it out .,1
2429,Wow ... Thats incredibly fast .,1
2431,Now that this exists I sure do hope its in the note 7 .,1
2432,Gives me a good excuse to take lots of 4k video .,0
2434,Yeah its a bug that a lot of us also are facing .,1
2435,What I did just until it gets fixed was to put those notifications into a separate folder so itll be mostly hidden from the main notification shade .,0
2437,Are you running a custom rom .,0
2438,S6 also .,1
2439,2edgyformem8 LMAOWow at least they admitted they suck.Seriously though just use a POS protector till ZAGG releases their Tempered Glass ... .,0
2441,The halo effect was a prime reason it hasnt released yet .,0
2442,I think the screen protectors may come out maybe eventually but then theyll have adhesive problems like everything else .,0
2444,They dont even have it on their website ... And yes people still use screen protectors because my galaxy s7 glass isnt scratch proof ... no one has a screen that can prevent scratches ... Pretty sure its in the post options somewhere but to make it easier you can now just include News Rumor etc in the title itself and the post will be automatically flaired that way as well .,0
2445,Settings gt Applications gt Default applications What app do you use .,0
2447,A lot of other major reddit apps have this capability ex Slide for reddit reddit is fun etc. .,0
2449,To make it easier you can now just include News Rumor etc in the title itself and the post will be automatically flaired that way as well .,0
2450,You need to abandon the karma below 5 crap .,0
2452,Not only that new people cant either without a mod .,0
2453,How about you just approve me per antler or give me enough karma so I dont even have this happen again .,0
2454,I shouldnt ha e to ask for a mod to Apple all my post .,0
2455,I figured out how to add a flair to my name ... Im assuming adding a flair to my posts will be relatively easy Please add a flair for S7 and S7 Edge How do I post here .,0
2456,I want to ask about a Samsung Ultrathin series 5 AMD thats slow as foobar .,0
2457,I use sync for Reddit on mobile I dont see any options to add a link flair while posting is it not possible .,0
2459,I dont believe so please somebody correct me if I am wrong .,0
2460,Dont believe you need to use it per say you just need to link a card .,0
2461,PLEASE NOTE http www.androidpolice.com20160308verizon who are a bunch of jerks took samsung pay off the the galaxy s7 and s7 edge but you can sideload it1 I pre ordered mine from best buy and havent gotten it yet .,0
2463,maybe ill get it later today .,0
2464,No worries man thought Id just pass the information on you never know what will help peopleEnjoy your charging pad Promo ends on Thursday so best of luck .,0
2465,Ahh sorry to hear that man .,0
2466,Did you preorder the wireless charging pad.I mean you could always return the charging pad for a refund then get a new one free .,0
2469,msung really shit the bed on this one .,0
2471,Because rushing manufacturing has worked out so well for them in the past ... deleted You have any idea how big Samsung is .,1
2473,The Note 7 despites its possibility to explode was a great device that introduced a lot of new features to Samsungs series of mobile devices S and Note series .,1
2474,In remembrance of this great device I created a short film or video titled R.I.P Note 7 to say goodbye.https www.youtube.comwatch.v88ztdBs9KEM lol yeah I got downvoted to hell for finding out about the Verizon announcment over the weekend .,0
2476,The only real reason to trade for the S7S7e is if you already have the Gear VR .,0
2477,Otherwise you might as well get a newer phone .,0
2478,OnePlus 3 I pre ordered my Note 7 and am still using it never replaced it .,0
2481,Not sure what his next move is ... I know for me Im still hoping for the Note 8 .,0
2482,I think the only thing they can do now is taking their time and make sure whatever theyre coming up with next does not have the same faults as the Note 7 .,0
2483,I think loyalists will be fine waiting an extra month or some than usual if it means making sure what we buy isnt exploding on us.I still could see some dumb pranksters trying to keep Samsung looking bad in the future though ... People in the past have turned in cracked note 7s and had difficulty getting them replaced but I heard in most cases that they did take cracked phones back .,0
2487,V20 has no stylus and is cheaply constructed and is ugly also will likely boot loop after a month .,0
2488,The Pixel XL is not water resistant and has no SD card slot and has a smaller screen .,0
2489,Everyone that got a note now has to compromise .,1
2490,It sucks .,0
2491,The demise of the best phone on the market .,1
2493,RipNote7 Im trying to figure out what to do as well .,0
2495,Im fuckin pissed i really dont want to compromise I was able to return it If there is it will probably be rebranded .,0
2496,I get your mad but you are very ignorant .,0
2497,Comparing samsung to Islamic terrorists is retarded .,0
2498,Calling them any sort of terrorist shows you have no idea what that word means and are just saying crap .,0
2499,Yes they rushed the phone but that wasnt the issue .,0
2500,The issue wasnt testing the issue was that one factory fucked up the fail safes for the battery on a very small number of phones .,0
2501,Samsung understanding the severity of the situation issued a recall and several warnings .,0
2503,I dont know why some of them exploded .,0
2504,But samsung didnt plan on it happening .,0
2505,At least they did the smart thing and discontinued it .,1
2506,The phones image was ruined .,0
2507,Nothing could bring it back Yes you need to turn it in .,0
2508,Yours is technically a replacement device .,1
2509,Though it didnt replace your device it replaced the previous iteration of the device .,0
2512,This was ran over whit nothing on the phone working Yes it is unsafe it seems to be a defect that effects all Note 7s regardless of being original or replacement .,0
2514,iPhone master race Its ok .,1
2516,No where near as nice as the s7s though US Its one video with a questionable test .,0
2517,Like that proves anything .,1
2518,The shills are out in force today I see .,1
2519,Good for you guys and girls ... Get that money .,1
2521,Close your eyes .,1
2523,Just get on your knees and take that money .,0
2524,I used to use Handcent .,0
2525,Not sure why a senior told me to use it and I did .,0
2526,Lately I have just been too lazy to change .,0
2527,Before it was a bitch to enable handcent and disable to stock app .,0
2529,the s7e felt much nicer in the hand but ive settled on the n7 I like how the screen is rounded on the note 7 more than the edge .,0
2530,Now I dont want my edge and I want a note 7 .,1
2533,Idk why but I have an s7 edge and seeing that I hate how curved the s7 edge is around the corners .,0
2534,I guess my case really covers them up because I havent noticed till now .,0
2536,I personally think the more rounded corners of the S7 edge better fit the Samsung theme as well .,1
2537,Looks like the S7 has a pink tinted AMOLED How is this 5.7 inches .,0
2538,The note 4 vs s7 edge shows a massive difference in size .,1
2539,Yeah I get is a curved screen but still Its not surprising .,0
2540,They added a world of features to the S7 .,1
2541,Plus they literally announced it and released it out of no where and offered free stuff with pre order purchases .,0
2542,Plus a lot of carries are offering two for one deals .,1
2543,people always want the newer model even if they have no idea HOW its better than the previous model and even IF the consumer even needs that level of improvement in the product thats what I did .,0
2544,I wonder what this means for the iPhones numbers ... Im from the Ph and even on land indoors my network coverage is poor ... unless the other networks really good and hes on it then maybe ... .,0
2546,Its beautiful .,1
2547,Thats a very nice shot .,1
2548,This was taken with the phone camera alone Its because its an Apple subreddit not a Samsung subreddit.If Im not mistaken the downvote button is for comments that are of no substance and do not add to the conversation .,0
2549,Not an I disagree so fuck you button .,0
2550,So if you posted this as a parent comment you would be rightfully downvoted .,0
2551,So cry more.Now .,0
2552,If you were posting on a thread about cameras and you were making a point about how a certain camera is better than another then people are just butt hurt over the obvious truth.As an iPhone user probably will be for a long time just for the fact that Im picky and android has too many issues I can wholeheartedly say that Samsungs cameras nowadays are better than those of the iPhones .,0
2555,No way my Note 3 could focus that close .,0
2556,Hell sometimes not even from a distance .,0
2557,Thank you .,1
2559,I took a similar picture with selective focus which didnt turn out as nice I focused on the center of the picture frame where the water drops are hence the reason the water drops and grass near the stem have high acuity .,0
2560,Personally I think the perceived fuzziness contributes to the depth and overall quality of the photo .,0
2563,Things this picture is 1 .,1
2571,My coworkers s7 edge fell down from his pocket and shattered too .,0
2572,This gorilla glass lowered in quality .,0
2575,It sucks .,0
2576,Makes me worried on my s7 obligatory asking_the_real_questions .,0
2578,The wallet glue failed and the phone fell between the elevator and the floor .,0
2581,Delivery people are not idiots and gasp he could also know about the release of the new phone2 .,0
2582,He knows who shipped it and I wouldnt be surprised if they know generally what the contents are eg .,1
2583,Electronics phone etc. for security of package handling3 .,0
2584,When I opened the door I said Oh wow I was planning on staying home all day tomorrow waiting for that to which he responded with my title .,0
2587,The same thing happened to me i got mime yesterday at about 5 From ups .,0
2588,No complaints from me rthatHappened Already in freaking love with it and I am at work and not even,0
2590,OTE http www.androidpolice.com20160308verizon who are a bunch of jerks took samsung pay off the the galaxy s7 and s7 edge but you can sideload it1 Most Ive found out is that its launching in 2016 very soon apparently.Its going to be expanding to China Spain Brazil the U.K. Canada and Australia.http www.digitaltrends.commobilesamsung pay newsixzz42AXBqrHI No worries aha glad I helped .,0
2593,Ahh no ... Only one day out.You never know what promos are next hang in there .,0
2594,It says you can get a free 30 gift card .,0
2595,I guess you could get a best buy gift card and get half of a wireless charger .,0
2596,XD It does include a notification icon on the watch face .,0
2598,What new apps are available .,1
2599,HAHA I was not trying to imply the fix would take ten minutes just a faster video .,0
2600,I linked the original in the description below the video .,0
2601,28 min ... no need for a heat gun unless you want to get of the display from the bracket .96 ethyl does the job better and faster .,0
2602,the back glass is super sturdy when it comes to twisting it if it isnt damaged already.using the plectrum to get the metal frame off is not needed you can easily press it out.taking the battery out is easy with 96 ethyl again .,0
2603,no need to losen the screw on the usb pcb until the very end .,0
2605,I wanted the s6 edge but got the Note 5 because I promised myself that a Note would be my next phone .,0
2606,No need for whos going to get the future note.I got the Galaxy S6 and as many others the s pen feature doesnt work unless its going to be something gimmicky.However in the future Ill get the Note 6 no doubts .,0
2607,Had the note 3 amazing phone missing the Note features .,0
2608,But writing with that edge would be a disaster .,0
2609,No thats the 100 Google Play card if you trade in your iphone for a Galaxy .,0
2612,It probably is ... Im not sure why I only got 1 email for this stuff .,0
2613,Nothing after .,0
2617,I just one and email that said it was pending .,0
2619,This morning I got and email from UPS that I had a package xoming .,1
2622,Yes thats the one I got .,1
2624,And today I got it .,1
2625,Think you just have to wait till you receive it .,1
2626,Still no update on my promotions ... If it comes to that I may have to .,0
2627,Thanks for the thought .,1
2629,Good idea Ill check .,1
2630,Something semi similar happened to me got fucked over by samsung support never buying another samsung product .,0
2631,Thats how they keep fucking you if you just let them .,1
2632,No need do go to negative right away .,0
2633,SamsungSupport on twitter has always been pretty responsive in my experience .,0
2634,Im sorry that you had this experience with T Mobile .,0
2635,With rates that cheap they have to cut corners somewhere right .,0
2636,It used to be that youd be stuck with a terrible network with them now that thats improved I guess its customer service and lack of uniformity in corporate store policies .,0
2637,T Mobile locations are absolute shit .,0
2638,The T Mobile phone supervisors are the absolute best .,1
2639,If you ever have a huge problem like this speak directly to a supervisor and explain what theyre doing wrong .,0
2640,Ive had a supervisor give us a 200 credit in the past .,1
2641,You ended up getting free phones somehow because the supervisors are the only ones that get stuff done .,0
2642,ATampT user here and I had the same experience .,0
2643,Literally walked into my store returned the phone and that was it ... Maybe were lucky .,0
2644,I dont know but that was a painless 5 minute return for me and it seems like on Reddit theres another person every day with issues of exchange or return on a worldwide recall.Granted I didnt have to do an exchange as I have a backup phone but I cant imagine its significantly more difficult .,0
2645,I guess the big issue here is if you can wait for the note 7 replacement or not .,0
2646,I personally will be fine without the note 7 for a few more weeks as Im not going to die without it which seems to be the case for most people online .,0
2647,Im sorry you had such a sour experience I just moved back to t mobile after a miserable time with VZW .,0
2648,I must have gotten lucky I tried 1 store while at work and it was clear they had no idea what they were doing .,0
2649,Stopped by another on my way home and it was night and day the whole process took 25 minutes because of content transferring between the note and s7 edge .,0
2651,Phone rep told me to go in store store people said I Was nuts .,0
2652,They just have a disconnect there but theyre still better than all the other carriers .,0
2653,I have thanks .,1
2657,I did go in store initially but he actually talked me out of exchanging it .,0
2658,Weird .,0
2660,Got ta be sure your dealing with a Corp owned store .,0
2661,My first problem was going into a t mobile independently owned store .,0
2662,They are the absolute worst in service and complete assholes .,0
2663,Ive been calling t mobile over 9 times my boyfriend has 3 times .,0
2664,We went to one location the shitty one then the good store .,0
2665,It took over 3 hours for the two stores and we were almost late for work .,0
2666,We now have loaner phones we had to pay taxes for and yesterday a t mobile phone support was going to call me back to order our new phones the iPhone 7 plus .,0
2667,Our bill is over 700 .,0
2668,Were stuck with free tablets because the shitty store pressured us to get them .,0
2669,Then after signing the papers he tells us theres a 75 restocking fee for each tablet .,0
2670,Loyalty dept wont take back the free tablets cause their not technically accessories but they are since you cant get them without ordering a note 7 .,0
2671,And our note 7s could have blow out our eyes cause the phone got fucking hot using it with a gear vr .,0
2674,Now Im afraid these s7 loaners are somehow gon na be our upgrades and we wont get the actual phone we want .,0
2675,Weve been with t mobile for 4 yrs .,0
2677,Im so tired of t mobile so called support .,0
2678,They dont do shit but placate you or like in the store you got associate yelling at another coworker on the phone .,0
2679,Its a shot show and its not totally t mobile fault but it is .,0
2680,And its also Samsung fault too .,0
2681,They made a battery that has created over 2 million people that have lost their shit on people just doing their job or in some cases they employees aint doing nothing to help .,0
2683,Yeah well this is Murica where everything is smoke and mirrors as everyone is just shaking in their boots worried they will be sued .,0
2684,Isnt it lovely .,1
2685,Not until they fix their TouchWiz RAM managment and put a decent storage with a decent speed and get rid of the UFS 2.0 garbage .,0
2687,Get yourself a package disabler and enjoy Wireless charging was only baked in since the S6 though .,0
2689,Im pretty sure you can buy cases for iPhone to get wireless charging .,1
2690,Lol if you need to ask the answer is no .,0
2692,You can already get Commuterhttp www.otterbox.comen usgalaxy note7commuter series casesam4 galaxy note 7.html Symmetryhttp www.otterbox.comen usgalaxy note7symmetry series casesam28 galaxy note 7.html and Defenderhttp www.otterbox.comen usgalaxy note7defender series casesam2 galaxy note 7.html for the Note7 .,0
2693,Im using the Commuter kept my Galaxy S4 saf,0
2695,e Ill take my chances with it again .,0
2696,i use tempered glass screen protectors from ebay for like 4 a piece .,0
2697,I go through about 4 a year and they have saved my phone more times than i can count .,1
2698,well worth 4 .,1
2703,Drop it the wrong way and it will crack .,1
2704,This will never change and of course there will be others with a cracked phone.Its called statistics .,0
2705,did you purchase it through samsung .,1
2709,Looks like Gorilla Glass 5 plus curved edges is a fail at this point .,0
2711,To prove that glass will shatter if it lands the wrong way .,0
2712,Mine is fine but I dont drop my phones .,1
2713,Not my screen but my back glass broke about 3 months after I got the phone I dropped it while I was sleeping .,1
2714,The phone was next to me while charging and I guess my arm got caught on the cord and the phone was pretty much just thrown onto a concrete floor .,0
2715,I am glad my screen is fine though .,1
2718,I shattered the back glass when it didnt have a case on shattered the front with a case on .,0
2719,Luckily its by the button and not in the middle of the screen .,0
2721,I feel like the only case that will protect the screen is a smart cover case .,1
2722,Oh man I was hoping there was a thread regarding this .,0
2723,I had a 5s before my note 7 and have been worryong about the screens integrity .,0
2724,In the 2 years I had my 5s the entire phone held up like a champ .,0
2725,I never once replaced the screen or phone .,0
2726,My concern with the note 7 was the edge style screen .,1
2727,Im curious about peoples experiences with Samsungs other edge style phones as well though as well as what case would potentially work best for the note 7 .,0
2729,Bought it on Friday smashed the upper left corner on Saturday .,0
2731,It doesnt interfere with functionality and a little bit of its beauty is blemished but the water resistance is done .,0
2732,So I will pay to get it fixed .,0
2733,T Mobile washes its hands of the whole thing sent me to Samsung.Edit Reason I dropped it .,0
2734,Had it on my lap about 18 off the pavement and that damn glass back is sooo slippery .,0
2735,had Galaxy s3 S5 and S7 edge .,0
2736,Dropped all of them multiple times most of the time without any case never had a shattered display Right .,0
2742,I have the same problem freaking S Pen keeps getting stuck stuck ffs Samsung Thank you for the heads up .,0
2744,This situation happened to me too .,0
2745,Hella pissed as I just got the phone .,0
2748,We have a new SPengate coming Im going to try to pick one up tomorrow thanks for the heads up .,0
2749,Note 5 suffers from it too .,0
2750,Mine is like that i have to flick it to open sadly my carrier was unable to help me as they had no phones in stock ill be going to my nearest Samsung service center next week .,0
2752,I originally had a 2014 Moto X but the screen cracked .,0
2753,They sent me an S5 as they had no Moto Xs in stock .,0
2754,A couple months later Im at work using my phone and put it down to take a call on the landline .,0
2756,After the call I picked my S5 back up but the screen wouldnt turn on .,0
2758,Battery restart etc and nothing was working but the phone would still vibrate that indicates it was accepting input .,0
2759,Called up Asurion and told them their replacement device they sent me stopped working for absolutely no reason and they having no S5 or Moto Xs in stock sent me a nice new gold S6 .,0
2760,A couple of years ago it felt like Id be on the phone with Asurion for 2 hours but recently it seems like a 20 minute call at most is all I need to make .,0
2761,All I had to do to submit my claim is go to their website sppmobileclaims.com and submit a claim using the phone number that I gave them when I bought protection plus .,0
2762,They called me next day to confirm what I said on the claim .,0
2763,The second claim went really wrong though because they sent me a letter saying they never received my old device so they were going to charge me 400 .,0
2764,I called them at the official number they have on their website and the rep. Just said I have to call USPS and give them the tracking number and say it was never delivered and USPS will give me a claim number and to just give that to an spp rep. and I wouldnt have to pay anything .,0
2765,They connect you to an actual person when you call the number really quickly and they are good at what they do Id rate them up there with Amazons customer service .,1
2766,Im thinking you were calling the wrong number and were talking to insurance for T Mobile or any other cellular provider that also deals with them and not Samsung protection plus which use the same insurance company .,0
2767,This is their correct number you call it or visit the website I mentioned earlier only those will put you in direct contact with their spp department and not their other departments .,0
2769,Because I would love this I wonder if the screen is still as easy to break .,1
2770,Bought one today came from an S6 .,1
2771,Its awesome I love the color green but not on this phone Why the heck arent these in Australia .,1
2773,Yeah but the active series never sell as well as the regular .,0
2777,We get it .,0
2781,Bluetooth will sync and connect with almost anything but you need to root and maybe do a few other installs and such to make it work .,1
2783,thanks .,1
2784,Your submission has been removed from rsamsung because your comment karma is below 5 this is in place to prevent spam.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically .,0
2785,SARCASM Sad to see Ars Technica going full retard on their headlines .,0
2786,I left Samsung after the S2 a few years ago for an LG up until now .,0
2788,I absolutely hated Touchwiz but these phones and the UI are fucking phenomenal .,1
2789,As soon as I found out there would be manual video controls I was completely persuaded to come back instead of looking to the G5 .,0
2790,Just my preference as a bit of a cameraphile .,1
2791,I hope that the reviews hold up and that the phone has decent longevity .,1
2793,I bought an S6 bought into all the hype ... GIVE ME BACK MY IPHONE .,0
2795,Sweet if so I would definitely upgrade to the Note 6 from my Note 4 I want to see some other innovative features in the note line up My pen doubles as a stand too .,0
2796,Yea thats happened a couple times for me .,0
2797,But there were also times when it really didnt work I was bummed.Ive found the registers where they use this contraption doesnt seem to work with SPay .,0
2798,Not sure but it must be the way the signal is transmitted .,0
2800,Whoops Go my S3 today well chuffed We already sell pink gold Not mines Unfortunately no Ive observed the same from last year Any news on when Verizon will get the blue .,0
2801,Downloaded the files from someone on XDA.Flashed with Odin and fully working .,0
2802,Screenshots of everything please Dial 06 and youll get a serial number QR .,1
2804,You only get 3 tries to get it right .,0
2805,I upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the S7 Edge and love it .,1
2806,I definitely couldnt wait for the S8 and was well due for an upgrade .,1
2807,still arguably one of the best Andr,1
2809,oid phones out there along with the 6P Note 7 and maybe the Moto Z .,0
2810,What it comes down to is if you want the phone now or in six months time ish .,0
2811,The S7 is a top phone .,1
2812,Waiting for S8 If thats the only two phones you are looking at then S7 for sure.You wont see a massive difference in performance since there is no 10nm yet.But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October.Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7.I suggest this because Google phones are updated and most secure android phones you will ever find .,0
2813,I am in the same predicament .,0
2814,I was gon na go with the note 7 I always wait for the storm to ride out as I call it the beta test and thankfully so .,0
2815,Since its big recall I am too scared to mess with it anymore .,0
2816,So Im waiting for the S8 edge .,0
2817,its just about 5 6 months away look at it as 137 days away ... .,0
2818,Not to be a dick but why would it increase the life of his phone .,0
2822,The s8 is reportedly going to be out Q1 or Q2 2017 depends if you can wait that long .,0
2823,The s8 will be better than the s7 but the s7 is still a top notch phone I think really at this point the S7 has everything you need .,1
2825,But wireless charging water resistant great camera great screen its really the whole package .,1
2826,Only thing lacking if you could even call it lacking USB C .,0
2828,The s8 will obviously be better and even if you dont like it you can get an s7 for cheaper by then I am with U.S. Cellular they are the only coverage in my rural area and they have a pretty limited phone selection .,0
2832,High quality phone for sure .,1
2833,The screen is glorious ... gorilla glass too I just switched from iPhone 6 to the Note 7 having to return it under the recall .,0
2834,I really never got used to the edge thing and battery life was not near even my 2 year old 6 but it was OK .,0
2835,I switched to the S7 as a loaner and was impressed with it until the camera lens spontaneously shattered only a week after I got it with the thing being inside a case nearly the entire time .,0
2836,Battery life is also kinda short depending on what the phone is doing but it feels like less than the 6 most of the time .,0
2837,I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation .,0
2838,I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair.Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones .,0
2839,Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor .,0
2841,Its bigger than the non plusses and large enough that I can still fat finger the buttons and get what I want typed in without too much stress and it still fits everywhere I want to shove it .,0
2842,If you can overlook the neon glow colors the AMOLED screen is still the nicest thing Ive seen especially at night when the black screen background is ... black .,1
2843,And being able to get content on and off of it without iTunes cancer is miraculous in and of itself .,1
2844,Chrome on Android kills Safari even on IOS 10 IMO .,0
2845,I dont think youd be missing anything going to the S7 if you have no other hooks into the Apple ecosystem .,0
2846,As long as it doesnt explode or shatter.Also ... compared to the Note 7 the S7 is noticeably faster ... most of the time there is no waiting for things to load but not noticeably faster than IOS 10 on my older device .,0
2847,I am in the same bloody boat .,0
2848,Currently using Note5 wanted to get a Note7 when it came out but then the phones were recalled and whole exploding battery fiasco thing kind of scared me .,0
2849,Decided to go for an iPhone7 but seeing the reviews and even the speed tests I am not sure it is worth the money and I am back to block 1 .,0
2850,Should I get the Note7 when it launches with safe batteries get an S7 Edge or wait for an S8 .,0
2851,So fucking torn between these three choices If only it wasnt ATampT exclusive .,0
2852,Id consider it if there was an unlocked International version .,0
2854,So worth it .,1
2857,Oh man im also torn at the moment .,0
2858,Im using an iPhone 6 right now and have been doing since it was released and im happy with the phone but im kind of tired with Apple locking everything down .,0
2859,iPhone 7 is just Apple helping me with the decision to switch over .,0
2862,I recently came from an iPhone 6 to an S7 Edge .,0
2863,It is an amazing phone and Im not worried about newer phones like the S8 coming out .,1
2864,This is because there isnt really anything that this phone is missing .,0
2865,It has a bloody massive battery great screen micro SD card support IP68 water resistance etc. .,0
2866,The S8 will most likely have the new iris scanner but honestly a finger print scanner is more practical and probably faster .,0
2867,What Im saying is that the S7 difference from an S8 wont be that big especially when you previously used an iPhone .,0
2869,I was told Id get mine carphone warehouse too 2nd October .,0
2871,Not giving up my phone unless there is like a super ridiculous time frame like January 2017 .,0
2872,Especially not going to iPhone again because I just got done transferring everything over it seems like .,0
2873,Hopefully the early October like they said is the later date .,0
2874,I prefer USB C. Coming from iPhone I cant imagine having to actually look and see which way the cord goes in each time .,1
2876,Not to mention the 64gb internal which is important for us folks who keep all our porn in Secure Folder which doesnt allow storing on the SD card .,0
2877,Also the screen is brighter AND dimmer .,0
2879,I had a Note 4 which was a great phone .,1
2881,Its resetting itself and freezing and now is stuck in a constant reboot loop .,0
2882,I argued with Sprint for 4 DAYS over them getting me out of my contract and selling me the phone with their new contract price because I didnt want to spend 850 on it .,0
2883,I finally got them to agree to drop my contract and start a new one so I can get the phone .,1
2886,Never even shipped it to me .,0
2887,Now my Note 4 is 100 dead and Im using my wifes old S5 .,0
2889,Samsung pinpointed the issue and resolved it a good while ago now .,1
2890,And replacement units were shipped out to stores .,0
2892,Rather than waiting even longer for that Samsung consulted with the Consumer Product Safety Commission .,0
2893,Now youre all waiting for word from the CPSC before the phones can actually be released.The original timetable had exchange units in stores by today or Friday .,0
2895,I stopped by best buy today jus,1
2897,t for curiosity and was told the replacement shipments were shipped out Monday .,0
2898,Whether or not that was factual I have no way of verifying ... but I also did not purchase my phone there employee account so he really had no incentive to lie to me .,0
2900,Thanks for the recommendation .,1
2901,Ill download it today and try it out .,1
2902,Upvote for the humor .,1
2903,I had a good laugh .,1
2904,I went from Samsung keyboard to Swiftkey ... now I use Google keyboard .,0
2905,You can type a word then select it in the recommendation bar up top to add it to memory.Alas I can cuss all day long without spell check .,0
2906,When comparing with the iPhone 5 keyboard and autocorrect which I owned and used for around a year before I purchased a Samsung S6 Edge have now had for a year also I found the autocorrect for the iPhone was far nicer .,0
2907,At first I put it down to just getting used to the new phones nuances but since then Ive realised I did just find typing a text less cumbersome on the iPhone .,0
2908,I frequently have to delete the autocorrection because the phone didnt recognise the word refill out the edited part then hit space only to have it autocorrect again .,0
2909,I dont know exactly why but this I think has been one of the bigger issues Ive had with switching that just hasnt settled in every other difference is now just normal and I struggle to remember how to navigate an iPhone .,0
2910,Not sure why youd want to drop so far down in performance but to each their own I suppose .,0
2911,My Note 4 was great and aged amazing .,1
2912,The only drawback was battery it would reach a certain point and then jump to very low numbers .,0
2913,Like it would go to 20 or 24 and drop to either 0 or 8 .,0
2914,Could be the battery or I could have damaged something with leaving it someplace hot because that seems to be the case with battery issues Ive seen .,0
2915,This ... I had iPhone4 then sgs3 now sgs5 and thinking of what to switch to next .,0
2916,I miss the smoothness of iPhone but keep remembering that end of 2 years of iPhone4 when I was so tired of the phone .,0
2917,With my sgs5 I can throw on a new launcher or get rid of all my old widgets and install new ones to tide me over till more options come out .,0
2918,I see the whole IOS is optimized for the hardware argument being thrown around a lot .,0
2919,I left IOS because the updates slowed my iPhone down to the point where it was almost unusable .,0
2921,The phone has gotten faster with updates particularly MM .,0
2922,The software experience is actually really good and its highly customisable .,1
2923,The hardware is the selling point for these phones .,1
2924,You get the best phone screen on the market .,1
2926,Awesome battery life .,1
2927,An amazing camera .,1
2929,Premium build quality .,1
2932,Samsung pay works in more places.Anything prior to the Note 4 is going to give a less than stellar representation of the Samsung experience as prior to that It honestly was a bad experience .,0
2933,Samsung have taken their game to the next level with their recent phones especially the S7 series .,0
2934,At the end of the day it will come down to your preferences stylus iris scanner and stuff like that are all great.Where as iPhone has the iOS eco system etc. .,0
2936,Force touch .,1
2937,I am amazed about how the headphone jack wont make you buy the iphone 7 .,0
2938,You still didnt see what apple has to say about this .,1
2939,it might be because the phone became waterproof so the headphone jack could be replaced with different earphones .,0
2940,Dont be so negative before the iphone 7s release Having owned Samsungs since the first galaxy I can tell you that Ive only had issues with one and that was the s3 and that was my fault .,0
2941,I dropped it 3 times not in a row down iron bark stairs .,0
2944,Ive now moved onto the s7 edge but my s5 is onto a new owner and still working fine .,1
2945,Owning a samsung is like owning a desktop .,0
2946,You have to care for it delete old shit watch out for nasty surprises and keep the skin flicks to a minimum .,0
2947,Genuine question as a recent iPhone to Android convert how does disabling too many apps ruin batterbattery life .,0
2949,Too bad a sub cant be unbiased and hear peoples opinions .,0
2950,Im not taking sides but this is some clear evidence of processor speed and RAM efficiency .,0
2951,Im moving on from my 6s plus to a note 7 .,1
2952,That screen and camera and no bezels got me Ill navigate android just fine I think .,1
2953,Plus I need to break free of the apple ecosystem now or I never will .,0
2954,IMO the note 7 is everything the iPhone plus should be but instead we just got an iPhone with a bigger screen thats all .,0
2957,Ill probably get one .,0
2958,Though it seems the IR blaster days are over Im in the same boat its gimmicky .,0
2959,From what Ive seen the type of cases I prefer to use on my phoneslow profileslim i might as well not even use it because so much of the edge is unprotected .,0
2962,But look at the lack of screen protection Samsung Galaxy Note7 Otterbox Symmerty Case Youll only be missing out on an Iris Scanner and 64GB Base Storage .,0
2963,If you dont need the S Pen I think the edge has got you covered .,1
2965,I will probably sell this if this is the case and go iPhone Nexus or Note 7 .,0
2966,Part of the reason why I bought this was because I assumed itd get updates without carrier interference but I could be mistaken .,0
2967,Time will tell but as of right now Im still happy with it .,1
2970,Terrible .,0
2971,gt Im very sorry for any confusion .,0
2972,Our unlocked devices do not receive updates .,0
2973,This is because carriers Becca is in need of some retraining because clearly Samsungs other unlocked international non branded devices can and do receive updates both full releases and security updates so yeah .,0
2975,just ignore Becca .,0
2976,I took it to the Samsung repair centre and they would have fixed it if my warranty was still valid but there was a little crack in the back so they quoted me for it.I ended up getting a wireless charger and that does work so if you can try a wireless charger to check it that might work for you I went into a phone store that had some lying out .,0
2977,I tried a few older cables and USBs but none were working I just had it in a Samsung Repair centre and none of theirs did either .,0
2978,Ive ended up just ordering a wireless charger for now Samsung wanted almost to fix it .,0
2979,Thanks I actual just gave that a shot in a store and it works so Ive ordered one from Amazon that will arrive tomorrow .,1
2980,I just want to say fuck you guys that constantly downvote when people need help .,0
2982,Thanks I gave that a go but no luck .,0
2983,I had it at a Samsung repair centre and they couldnt get it either quoting me almost for repair .,0
2985,Wireless charger for now seems to be a good idea .,1
2986,Id YouTube videos on how to fix charging port in the meanwhile .,0
2987,I loaded pokemon go into this just for the recentsback button disable .,0
2988,This makes battery saver mode on pokemon go use able Hoped that researched isnt wiped with a cloth No one in the US even fully utilizes 4G yet .,0
2989,Looks really cool Sweet an Olympic edition ... Are one of the features a Rio Anti theft deterrent .,1
2990,Beautiful I guess ... it becomes relevant again in 4 years ... when youve already switched over to GalaxyS11 ... .,1
2991,Ive got nothing .,0
2995,rally no one asked for this Does this work for the Note 4 .,0
2996,I tried to develop for Tizen I really tried .,0
2997,But it felt like I was back to the times of the MFC and Visual Studio 6 .,0
2998,Terrible IDE terrible documentation everything obscure only way to get anything done is by a LOOOOOT of trying and error and hacking around .,0
2999,Completely frustrating experience I gave up.So if that article is right which I really hope its not that would be really bad NO QUALITY APPS but the Samsung ones .,0
3000,More like this isnt good for anyone .,0
3001,Not great for Android because thatd mean a huge piece of the market share goes bye bye terrible for Samsung because people WANT Android even if that means they get TouchWiz with all the bloat Samsung can give and certainly not awesome for us either Nexus 6p .,0
3002,Honestly nexus is the only legitimate game in town when it comes to android .,0
3003,Mobile suicide Yeah unless it ran android apps and more efficant .,0
3004,If Tizen is anything thing like the bloatware Samsung apps I have adios Samsung .,0
3008,But that doesnt mean that its total BS either .,0
3009,Ill take Methods of Ruining a Successful Business for 400 Alex. RIP Samsung .,0
3010,Ill miss the good old days even more now .,0
3011,You know before the whole Apple ifying mess .,0
3012,Its probably going to accelerate now ... good samsung PricerajaWell known for its inside Samsung sources ... .,1
3013,Dont believe everything you read .,1

3015,If its real or nothttps camo.derpicdn.net0e1e449250ca92047524f3f574105f17db1cc023.urlhttps3A2F2F33.media.tumblr.com2F33594abbb4f360807017c23b7665a8992Ftumblr_nv7dhqGLAn1unv2fuo1_250.gif Im really stoked to see this and for this reason and I kinda dont want the Note 7 now .,0
3016,It takes quite a few tries for them to get it right .,1
3017,The Edge on the earlier Note didnt make much sense until they brought it to both sides .,1
3018,I feel like the first generation iris scanner is going to have some issues .,1
3020,Apparently unlocked international phones arent compatible .,0
3022,I think Id like it to finally come to Canada Hopefully your bank will be on there soon .,0
3023,They are constantly adding new banks .,1
3025,Its good .,1
3026,I just bought the gear fit and love it .,1
3029,Now that I know that the samsung watches are convenient and are actually useful Ill get the new gear s3 whenever that comes out .,0
3030,I like how is only flashes a symbol .,0
3031,Wow .,1
3033,amazing COME ON REGIONS DAMMIT .,1
3034,And still nothing for canada Man fuck BBVA Compass .,0
3035,Theyve been saying g that theyll do it for months now all the while they support apple pay .,0
3037,Im getting the S7 when it releases and I want to be able to use Samsung pay day one .,0
3038,Still no Santander ... I told them that this may be worth leaving them over and Im about to make good on that very very soon ... Still no Fucking 53 ... .,0
3039,wow Fuck Wells Fargo .,1
3040,Why no Huntington Wow the credit union and charlotte metro get Samsung pay before Wells Fargo ... thats just sad .,0
3041,Best buy has had most of these deals for the last week .,1
3042,Oh thank God .,1
3044,It uses this idiotic Uconnect radio system that makes me want to drive my car off a cliff every time I use it let alone connect my phone to the car .,0
3045,Should not have to listen to 20 text reply options in order to send a message .,0
3046,This is fantastic news .,1
3048,Works like a charm and by far the best phone Ive ever used minus the Note 7 which I have used for few weeks before having to return it .,1
3049,Ive tried several other Android phones and never found anything better than Samsung .,0
3050,One advice I would give would be to keep the device memory usage below 80 Keep your 6P for another 5 months .,0
3051,Youll probably regret getting the S7 later on .,0
3052,Samsung wont even fix the phone now if you break the screen ... Id stay away until they get all their problems under control Thanks for all of your input I will probably still wait then .,0
3053,Id suggest waiting for the new coral blue to come out and snag it then .,0
3054,I just ordered the S7 flat because I found a good deal .,0
3055,Otherwise I would not be paying 700 right now with the S8 releasing in march .,0
3056,wait s8 it will be a gamechanger even for mobile VR 4k .,0
3058,If you can get a good deal on the S7 500 range then go for it.Otherwise I would take the next few months to save up for the S8 which is probably going to be 800 dollars .,0
3059,I have the S6 Edge and was going to upgrade to the S7 but its better to just save the few hundred dollars for the upcoming S8 .,0
3060,Got my S7 Edge nearly 2 weeks ago and I absolutely love it .,1
3061,Its an amazing phone .,1
3062,If my carrier offers an upgrade program then I sure will but if not I dont see myself being too fussed about it .,0
3065,If I were you I would wait a couple months for the S8 because Im sure that will be a good phone but I do have a Galaxy S7 and the only thing I dont like about it is that its not the Edge .,0
3067,Just search Galaxy tab and there will be a plethora Highly doubt Apple will be doing any such thing .,0
3069,More iMessage users .,0
3070,At this point I recommend waiting for the S8 .,1
3071,Its right around the corner .,1
3073,jesus christ I work for a samsung authorized service center and wed get absolutely reamed by Samsung if we ever did that to a customer.If you kick up a fuss you should be able to get an exchange .,0
3074,Samsung is crap in software The problem is at least in some cases you really dont know how crappy a companys customer service is until you need service on a product youve already bought and paid for .,0
3075,that sucks .,0
3077,After calling again almost every day and contacting Twitter support they still have not called me .,0
3078,Twitter support told me that they couldnt help me and my situation was being handled by a special team who apparently dont know how to use a phone.Support on Twitter told me to call and ask for their specialized team to which I did .,0
3079,The response from the phone rep was that she did not know what they were referring to and that they do not have a specialized team .,0
3080,Does anyone know of a Government consumer protection group I can file a complaint with .,0
3082,I cant wait on this any longer I dont care that you have a recall going on .,0
3083,I had my ticket in before they screwed up the second batch of phones this should have been handled weeks ago .,0
3085,Totally bogus lawsuit .,0
3086,Samsung doesnt even use slide to unlock do they .,0
3087,Samsung has stolen more patents than any other company in history .,0
3089,http www.theverge.com20142175418616samsung sues dyson following intolerable copycat claims I have a Note 5 and it does the same thing ... Wierd .,0
3091,Im unable to find it on my s6e .,0
3092,Im also on Verizon Yep I updated my phone like three days ago .,0
3093,And for what its worth im on atampt as well I have the Verizon Galaxy s6 edge and I am having trouble uninstalling the gear vr service app .,0
3094,I see it on my list of apps but the disable button is grayed out .,0
3095,The only option I have is to force stop .,0
3098,Are you charging over night with the fast charger .,0
3099,That could be a large part of your problem right there .,0
3102,ically stop charging at 100 especially if they are fast charging .,0
3103,You may have overcharged your battery .,0
3104,Ive also just started experience an extreme battery drain on my Galaxy S6 Edge today .,0
3105,Really not sure what the issue is .,0
3106,Battery seems to be reporting a heavy use of Google Services but Im curious if it has anything to do with the recent update that came out a few days ago .,0
3109,It usually lasts through the workday at about 60 but its nowhere near that today .,0
3110,Its also noticeably more hot to the touch today .,0
3111,Battery seems to be in overdrive for whatever reason .,0
3113,its the gear vr app Fixed the battery issue but keyboard is still constantly collapsing while Im typing .,0
3115,Kinda glad I stuck with the S6 for now.If youre experiencing overheating even when not using or charging your phone it could be down to a particular app .,0
3116,Luckily the Battery optimiser setting allows you to stop apps from sapping energy when the phone isnt in use .,0
3117,Go to Settings gt Battery gt Battery Usage gt More gt Optimise battery usage and tap All Apps .,0
3118,Doing this will stop apps from working in the background even when youre not using the phone.If overheating persists you can try wiping the cache partition .,0
3119,With your Galaxy S7 turned off press and hold the Power Home and Volume Up buttons together until you see the Samsung logo and then release .,1
3121,Tap the Volume Down button to scroll down the list of options and then select Cache Partition by pressing the Power button.If all else fails a factory reset might be in order .,0
3122,If that proves unsuccessful its time to return the S7 to Samsung for a replacement .,0
3123,In another thread someone said that having the Gear VR app installed was causing this .,0
3124,My Galaxy S7 Edge did indeed overheat using the charger that came with the unit the adaptive fast charger .,0
3125,My wifes unit also gets hot to the touch while charging .,1
3126,As a result of my unit overheating it discolored and pitted the area around the Home Button very close to the charger connection .,1
3127,I was given a reference number then received an email that my complaint was without merit .,0
3129,Nowwith the bs update I have a two 600 useless paperweights .,0
3130,I am pissed .,0
3131,It looks like the phone was put on a hotplate .,0
3132,The battery hasnt vented so thats not what caused it .,0
3133,And it only seems to be melted around the edges those in which would be the first to touch a hot plate or frying pan on an oven .,0
3134,I say this because the CPU which is what generates the most heat in the device is located in the center by the camera not the outer edges of the phone .,0
3135,I think someone just tried to pull a fast one to get their phone replaced on you .,0
3137,Yes it is .,1
3138,damn I find the curve display so annoying .,0
3142,Says the guy using Generic Rectangular Block Phone 3698 ... I really hope they keep the 5.1 and 5.5 models whether they both have the edge or not .,0
3143,No idea why .,0
3146,Thats right ... I am buying iPhone 7 ... I have no idea why SAMSUNG does that .,0
3148,Taking pictures of a note 7 with an iphone .,1
3149,triggered Are all of the prototypes out there using some kind of Screen protector to hide the logos .,0
3151,I dont believe it .,1
3152,Hard to tell if theyre notifications or shortcuts I hope these turn out well .,1
3153,Ive been looking for some decent bluetooth earbuds .,0
3156,Lets just hope that it will eventually arrive ... hopefully ... Make believe clickbait .,1
3157,Samsungs flagship phones historically tend to get two major Android versions so it should .,0
3158,I want to believe but I seriously doubt it .,0
3160,More likely closer to spring of 2017 .,1
3161,N910G Note 4 in Australia still hasnt got it .,1
3163,Considering the update will have to go through my carrier I seriously doubt Ill have it by the end of the year .,0
3164,There are people in China who can afford it unfortunately .,0
3165,Yes they do only in black deleted Up until this point we never needed to contact customer service .,0
3167,This is why Ill never buy Samsung anything ever again .,0
3168,Their customer support is absysmal and the products dont last .,0
3169,Unfortunate my sons tab3 has touch go out on the screen rmad it they fixed it and sent it back no cost manufacturer warranty with no problems or issues had worked for almost 2 years since .,0
3172,prizelogic has been screwing me over too .,0
3173,Sorta late now but did you try to return it through where you purchased it before contacting Samsung .,0
3174,This would have been a perfect situation to do a cc charge back if you used an amex or some other cc that has their customers back .,0
3175,same here Key bank can suck my cock they owe me so much money Edit Two banks were removed they must have not been ready yet .,0
3176,They had Android Pay day one and Navy Federal beat them to the punch with Samsung Pay yet their customer service responses on this issue dont show too much hope .,0
3178,Unfortunately I dont think that Capital One has any plans to support Samsung Pay .,0
3180,It just goes to show that if smaller banks and credit unions can offer Samsung Pay support for their customers that larger banks and issuers have no excuse for not offering it too .,0
3181,A bunch of smaller banks I presume that Ive never heard of but I saw PNC and Im all good .,0
3183,Discover has said they wont be ready to support SP until early 2016 .,0
3184,Wells Fargo has no excuse since they are already supporting Apple and Android Pay .,0
3185,Supporting Samsung Pay would be extremely simple for banks already supporting Apple Pay and Android Pay .,0
3186,They probably want Samsung to pay them to support SP .,0
3187,Well I mean its usually quicker for me to either pay in cash or hand them a card .,0
3188,So I rationalized the added step of dealing with loading the app was that if I used it 5 times Id get a good reward .,0
3190,I mean I could have seen them scale it back a little be like OK you need to use it 10 times then maybe 20 etc etc. .,0
3191,But they went from like 5 times for like 6 months or so to like 50 .,0
3192,I switched banks for this reason .,0
3194,Its worth the 6 a month bank of America charged me for a checking account .,1
3195,WTF dude ... Ive only made like 5 purchases so far .,0
3197,You need to see Samsungs perspective too .,0
3198,Many people just use their service to get the giftcards once or twice Doing this they maintain customer loyalty while at the same time giving out rewards I just won the gear fit two on my second redemption of points .,0
3199,So theyre kinda cool .,1
3201,Credit card dispute is your friend here .,1
3202,Call your credit card company let them know what happened send them the tracking information and tell them that you havent received the credit yet .,1
3203,Yeah I suppose Im at that point now .,0
3204,I was hoping to publicly shame them into doing the right thing or to find contact info for someone in the company who could actually help me but I guess I should have known better .,0
3207,he doesnt give a crap about customer service either .,0
3208,And incredibly my credit card requires me to print and fill out a form that must me mailed to them with supporting documents to dispute a charge .,0
3209,... and both of my printers are unable to print the stupid 2 page black and white document because theyre each out of 1 of the color inks .,0
3210,... and my van has been in pieces the mechanics for 2 fn months now while he tries and fails to fix the ac .,0
3211,... and my car has expired inspection stickers and a broken windshield so I shouldnt be driving it anywhere other than the glass shop but I NEED MY MONEY BACK FIRST SAMSUNG .,0
3212,thanks for the replies and listening to me whine everybody .,1
3213,Credit card dispute definitely if all else fails return the Best Buy phone and use the one they shipped .,0
3214,The products themselves have been fantastic .,1
3215,Its Samsung.com thats the problem .,0
3216,Ive never needed to return a phone or get warranty repairs before dealing with them .,0
3218,I wanted an unlocked phone this time so I went to Samsung.com .,0
3219,Dont make that mistake and you should be fine .,0
3220,I keep hearing all these claims of from what Ive seen and mine has scratches and all I did is put it in my pocket and I believed the hype and have gotten more paranoid .,0
3221,But Ive seen little picture evidence to support the claims .,0
3222,Outside of display models the JRE video and a couple random pics on the net where are all the pics ... Ive also heard multiple reports of no scratches from everyday commuters to construction workers but like all things the negatives seem to get the most attention.Ive had mine since day one with a case covering the back and naked on the front .,0
3223,Ive been careful probably over protective and I have no scratches ... Yet ... .,0
3224,Fingers crossed but Im beginning to think the sky isnt falling .,0
3225,The back of the phone isnt as strong as the front of the phone .,1
3226,I use to have an iphone that was all glass and it scratched like crazy .,0
3227,The important thing is I learned to go commando and not care about cases anymore .,0
3228,Sure my GS5 looks like its been through war but Ive enjoyed its beauty everyday for the past 2 years without it being wrapped around a giant condom .,1
3229,Yep me too and I just got my Note 7 on Wednesday .,0
3230,I used my HTC One M8 for a whole year with no screen protector and it has a couple real real light scratches .,1
3231,I never felt the need to use a screen protector but Im going to have to here ... Get mad .,0
3233,Good stuff .,1
3235,deleted yeah i felt the same way about it too .,0
3236,because for that i could use the fingerprint reader Yeah thats my main concerb with iris scanner i hope they update it so you can acitvate it by holding one of the volume buttons on lock screen or something similar My idea is to try a no lock screen app .,0
3237,It should attempt to open the phone when the screen is turned on which should be halted by the Iris scanner then just look at it This is the best tldr I could make original.confirms galaxy s7 active waterproofing issues.html reduced by 67 .,0
3238,Im a botgt This characteristic was also bestowed upon the Galaxy S7 Active released by ATampT a couple of months ago in June but following a water resistance test conducted by Consumer Reports it was determined that the Galaxy S7 Active variant was not as efficient in keeping water away from its internals as its standard counterpart.gt Samsung replied by stating that they ampquotStand behindampquot the Galaxy S7 Active IP68 certificate but more recently the company backtracked and confirmed that some Samsung Galaxy S7 Active units are faulty and their water resistance is compromised.gt In other words Samsung wonamp039t offer lifetime warranty for the faulty units and although new stock seems to have been shipped to ATampT prospective Samsung Galaxy S7 Active buyers donamp039t seem to have a way of determining whether the unit they are about to buy is part of the old or the new stock.chance itll be fine but is that 1 really worth a 700 phone .,0

3266,My T Mobile Note 5 is still on Aprils security patch .,0
3269,NL here no updates Just got my edge updated .,0
3270,Checked all day so must have just came out during the evening and probably tomorrow if not everyone got it yet .,0
3271,Not rolled out to me yet Ive been on iPhone for a couple years but the s7 edge makes me want to move back .,0
3272,Really waiting to see about the note 7 .,1
3273,Good the s pen is OK but It does need some touching up before people would use it daily Any news on a release date .,1
3275,I usually skip around phones a bit and have never had a note for some reason .,0
3276,Id like a phone to stick with for a few years and this will probably be the one .,1
3277,And on that website the best comment award ... That s probably why they couldn t provide one .,0
3278,Took 3 weeks to get a replacement .,0
3280,Hopefully Google really does put some emphasis on tablets with N. Android tablets havent nearly hit their potential yet .,0
3281,It totally is .,1
3282,I dumped my nexus 9 for one and never have looked back .,0
3283,The tab S2 is the best android tablet out currently and this is not to put down on the pixel C. Its just if you want a stable light and reliable device ... .,0
3285,Expensive doesnt mean better .,1
3286,Why does it start to fall apart .,0
3287,Ive been looking into the surface 3 as well .,0
3289,And I cant decide if I prefer windows or Android on my tablet .,0
3290,I want to replace my Note Pro 12.2 .,0
3291,I wish it was sooner than later .,0
3297,Just check if your is unlocked after the update or not .,0
3298,Im still wearing my Apple Watch SS even without my IPhone .,0
3299,Still a nice watch .,1
3303,losing the phone was no big deal for me but I miss the watch the most .,0
3309,If you do get the s7 download the package disabler app .,0
3310,I dont know if youve heard of it but it is amazing .,1
3311,I disabled all the bloat ware on my note 4 and now it runs extremely fast and smooth compared to when I first got it .,0
3312,This is wonderful news .,1
3313,Ive had an iPhone since the original and just today 15 minutes ago in fact ordered a silver S7 Edge .,1
3314,I mainly use my Apple Watch for reminders .,0
3315,Does the Gear S2 show reminders from your phone .,0
3317,Is it as good as they say .,1
3318,The Gear S2 is a pretty cool watch easier to navigate around with the circle dial vs. the crown thing on Apple .,1
3319,The only challenge is there are fewer apps but who needs so many specific apps on a watch anyway .,0
3322,I had every iPhone since the 2g but this phone is clearly in a league of its own .,0
3323,I actually havent bought a watch yet since the always on display is actually nice .,1
3324,If I do I will get the Huawei watch since I hated the moto 360 .,0
3325,Im experimenting with this transition and I miss my Apple Watch a lot more than I do the iPhone.Im coming from an iPhone 6s Plus to the S7 Edge .,0
3326,Mixed feelings so far but Im chronicling the experience in more detailhttp mariusmasalar.mesamsung galaxy s7 day 1 .,0
3328,Probably Android Wear over Gear S2 .,0
3331,Samsung Pay is supposedly coming to the U.K. and Spain along with the release of the S7 .,0
3332,Im sure Samsung will have some kind of promos aimed at U.K. Samsung Pay users when it is released there .,0
3333,I have 4 credit cards only 1 company is supported but that card is not yet supported.This is like the 3rd free swag Ive not gotten of no fault of my own ... Im really hoping they reintroduce expandable storage .,0
3334,That was one of their strongest selling points imo and I dont know why they went away from that .,1
3337,No notification or anything Aww I wish I got the headphones in black http promo.samsungpromotions.com So ATT .,0
3338,According to Verizons website they are already back on sale ATT will have them back up after the 21st I just got mine on the 20th after trying to go to the store to order it and the manager just gave me one to purchase that day .,0
3339,I didnt have a Note before and I ordered A Note 7 from Verizon a few hours ago .,0
3340,The order status has an expected ship date of 920 .,0
3342,Whats all this Im hearing about a 1021 relaunch date then .,0
3343,Awesome .,1
3344,As someone looking to upgrade to it Ive not heard much about the re release so this got me pretty excited .,1
3345,Is there going to be any kind of promotion or bonus to bring people back to the Note 7 .,0
3346,I am considering getting one now that the battery issue is over but dont want to miss out on any special offers .,0
3347,So should I turn off my onky means of communication while I am on vacation and need it .,0
3348,Wtf deleted I brought mine back today and got the S7 Edge ... Not worth waiting months for a replacement when mine could catch fire No USB C on the S7 Edge means no bueno .,0
3349,Im just annoyed the feds are involved now .,0
3351,Also what about my fit bit free gift Me No Yes but resells are different from retail sales .,0
3355,Interesting Typically the warranty does not apply to anyone except the original owner not you in this situation bc you bought it on swappa .,1
3358,Dont know why they wouldnt replace one that was bought through a 3rd party.If worst comes to worst go to www.bestbuy.comnote7info and sign up for updates .,0
3359,And go to the carrier store and tell them you bought it out of town or something to that effect.On another note who TF buyssells a gt2 week old phone on swappa ... edit words That wont work .,0
3363,I even tried doing it via online chat and was told the same thing .,0
3364,Cos thats so easy and risk free s Makes sense .,0
3365,Since Verizon occasionally does open enrollment for phone insurance thatll probably be your only way of hopefully getting onto a newer revision .,0
3367,The few times Ive used them I havent had any major issues but theres usually someone out there with a bad Asurion experience .,0
3368,Yeah Id contact the CPSC Maybe its a copy .,0
3369,Note about the What 6 Im a bot bleep bloop .,0
3370,Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit rsamsungpay \ x post from r \ samsung \ Possibly found a way to re enable Samsung Pay after rooting.https np.reddit.comrSamsungPaycomments4ls85dxpost _ from_rsamsung_possibly_found_a_way_to_refooter ^ If you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads .,0
3371,^ \ InforTotesMessenger ^ ^ Contactmessagecompose.torTotesMessengerbot Shouldnt you read the post and realize that he said he would have called except its Memorial Day and therefore he cant .,0
3372,Well of youre willing to trust the device with information like bank accounts and card information you better hope they have everything secure with no possible intrusions .,0
3373,So maybe waiting is better then having a feature that comes with a great risk .,1
3374,Return it as Not fit for purpose if the watch was advertised as havingor going to have soon a feature and doesnt then the watch as it stands isnt fit for purpose .,0
3375,I know youre joking but still hate you for getting my hopes up I mentiond this in another thread about the same issue .,0
3377,They also advertised MapMyRun intergration as a premier partner.So I bought the watch .,1
3378,Then I learned that they lied about Samsung Pay as it wasnt actually available for the watch .,0
3379,Then I learned that MapMyRun actually wasnt available either with no plans of ever actually making it available in the future.The Nike intergration is absolute shit and has tons of problems so its nearly useless .,0
3380,And there are no other alternatives since the app store is a total and complete joke .,0
3383,Most everything else is junk.I think I bought my last Samsung watch .,0
3384,Tizen isnt going to be taking off anytime soon but they refuse to let it go .,0
3388,I just saw this and now its the 15th where Im at ... You may not be eligible for the next promo .,0
3389,I think 30 is the best well get for a while and its a good deal .,1
3390,I just dont want to start another credit card just to use it .,0
3391,Bank support is more important than promotions .,1
3392,I registeredadded a card yesterday amp I am not seeing the promotion under personalized offers .,0
3394,AMEX is allowed .,0
3397,Its a really convenient way to pay .,1
3398,Youve bruised your phone .,0
3399,Your LCD is broken so the only solution is to replace it .,0
3400,This happened to my wifes S4 so I paid a repair place 80 to install new screen and LCD and it was good as new .,0
3403,The phone is piss weak .,0
3404,It will still plug into a pc fine backup all your info pics contacts etc. A replacement screen for s4 when I looked was about 120 quid and isnt too bad a job as the lcd unit in its entirety needs replacing replacing just the glass is waaaaay more complicated .,0
3405,Getting someone to replace my screen for me e.g. Carphone Warehouse was more like 160 quid and they will completely reset to manufacturer settings .,0
3406,Good,1
3409,Any chance you have a picture think I am having a similar issue Im sorry .,0
3411,I agree I wouldnt upgrade if it means my gear vr wont work its actually a upside down regular micro usb port in the pic not a usb c That looks a hell of a lot like Type C to me I think its just the angle but only time will tell .,0
3412,From that angle it looks a lot like a Type C .,0
3413,After I got my Nexus 6P I actually dont mind the Type C .,1
3414,The faster charging is my primary advantage .,1
3415,As long as Samsung does what Google does and includes a charging cable but a Type A to Type C cable I have no complaints .,0
3416,She is obviously an Apple fanboy .,1
3417,In this article http www.autoomobile.comnewsiphone 6s or samsung galaxy s6 a clear choice40023689she compares the S6 and iPhone 6S and says that the iPhone wins in the features department simply because of 3D touch .,0
3418,She does mention that the S6 has a heartrate monitor infrared transmitter and wireless charging but those are just mentioned as an afterthought as if they have no value whatsoever .,0
3419,It looks like its written by an apple fanboy He is no doubt paid by Apple .,0
3420,This is a worthless article .,0
3421,You could make the same argument picking an android phone with a better battery than the ip6 and say well you better switch platforms .,0
3422,gt11 hours of web browsinggt12 hours of video playbackI fucking wish lol This article literally says nothing relevant whatsoever .,0
3423,Considering the only real thing its comparing is battery life the iPhone 6 is still sad in every other category .,0
3424,feels like it the way the writer uses the word anyhow just makes it seem more opinionated rather than informative .,0
3425,especially as it does state it is better than other android competitors .,0
3427,Haha its actually my first Samsung device gt Signal anntannaeSignal anntannae courtesy of uZanderGarner thanksies Theyre the real MVP .,0
3429,SDI is still apart of Samsungs brand though .,0
3430,Accurate title I guess but this was my thought .,0
3431,Samsung is finger pointing and may be at the end of a lawsuit because of it .,0
3432,gtSamsung was quick to blame the battery for causing some Note 7 devices to catch fire but it has since widened its investigation after replacement phones using batteries from Chinas Amperex Technology also caught fire .,0
3433,Why is the thumbnail BestBuy PRC stickers I alternate between 2 themes Android N and Grace UXBut i think grace ux was pulled from the theme store I love the themes but I havent paid for any yet .,0
3434,My favorite free themes are called Alien Theme Vintage Mountains Whale Live Pug Retro and Impressionism .,0
3435,If I were going to pay for themes I would have a hard time choosing between Poppy Retro Cafe Theme and V window theyre super lovely .,0
3436,Theres also one called MaterialisticUIhttp i.imgur.comsDpZDdN.png that looks like what Daredevils Matt Murdock would look like if he were trapped inside a phone theme .,0
3437,No Im using sd darkness right now I think it looks great plus its free .,0
3440,Keeps me on my toes .,0
3442,Ill take it over my dying note 4 any day .,0
3443,I can barely get Bluetooth to work properly and my battery discharges faster than a virgin in a brothel .,0
3444,Galaxy S7E has the same issue .,0
3446,The practical application is when you go to show someone a photo and it takes 27 seconds to wake up the device and open Gallery .,0
3448,While I dont think this is going to be the same level problem as I had with my S6 Active on Lollipop I still think it is important to let the manufacturer know that it is something that should be addressed as if they dont already know .,0
3449,While it would be nice for it to have the memory to go back to where it left off this doesnt put me off of getting Note .,0
3450,I have tried a Note and iPhone and given both a try Note 7 please .,0
3451,I just cant do iPhone I dont like the ios or anything really .,0
3453,Plus the Note 7 has much more use behind it than the hardware I have found .,1
3454,In my book the Note still leads for me because I have other needs for it that iPhone does not have .,0
3455,Note 5 user here if you watch through to the second round the user opens the apps a second time and on the Note 7 they have to reload completely into memory .,0
3456,So your saying a program that is written to benchmark Apple products doesnt properly benchmark a Samsung product .,0
3457,Go ahead and try to argue the whole IOS and Android app thing and youll be wrong because Apple holds everything from its hardware to the software that it runs on .,0
3458,Samsung makes the hardware and then adds its own flavor to the software that Google maintains .,1
3459,Completely different it isnt an Apples to Apples comparison .,0
3460,Try comparing it to another Android phone instead youd be allot closer .,0
3461,Dang 8 years and we are still having this argument .,1
3462,Honestly these tests are useless for me becaues I dont care about a few seconds Wonder whats the next excuse after iphone wins the same test with Note 7 running 1080p or 720p Cant be worse than the note 5 ... if not Ill take the storage expansion and bad ram management over my note 5 all day.My phone isnt my overclocking gaming rig and benchmarking my phone is not important to me .,0
3463,I dont need it to render video or run over clocked for 8 hours on aida64 or prime 95 with ihigh temperatures.Some people really buy phones for reasons other than calling and media .,0
3467,Ah yes for all the times I want to open and then immediately close all of the apps on my homescreen .,0
3468,Exactly this the first disappointment for me was that the Galaxy Note 7 comes with the same specs as S7E but I still hoped that with Grace they will fix the ram managment issue and was proven wrong This submission has been randomly featured in rserendipity a bot driven subreddit discovery engine .,0
3469,More here https www.reddit.comrSerendipitycomments4xcsa1note _ 7_has_poor_ram_managment_as_well_xpost_from Very poor comparison would you buy a computer if it had the same performance .,0
3470,This is probably the best description of phone speed Ive read.http www.iphonehacks.com201503iphone 6 vs samsung galaxy s6 compared in a speed test.htmlAs you can see the difference between these rival flagships is really negligible .,0
3471,While the iPhone 6 proved to be ever so slightly quicker at loading some apps the S6 Edge was quicker at loading others .,0
3473,This is in India right .,1
3474,The guys writing is terrible too Meanwhile back in Cupertino Cyanogenmod .,0
3476,You make it sound like an excuse for what is a lousy form of adaptation .,0
3477,The diversity Android has is hurting the platform as it not only slows down timed updates but also causes competition within the platform that Isnt to any customers benifit .,0
3478,This darned thing has been bothering me ever since I got the phone.I know you can change the icon using the SIM setup in Settings but is there a way to COMPLETELY remove it.Id appreciate any help you can give.Thank you .,0

3482,On my Netflix app on my Samsung TV theres a whole section just for 4k content .,0
3483,Im sure its streaming in 4k Even 720 looks good ... 4K is just ... .,0
3484,Good er .,1
3485,Yeah ive got the 4k package on netflix .,1
3488,just not sure if it was in UHD 4K .,0
3490,Youll see all the titles available in 4K .,1
3492,The Netflix app says 4K UltraHD on all the shows that have it I think you must have the 4 stream package to stream in 4K Wow it appears mine has done the same .,0
3494,Same here I submitted mine yesterday Mine says th,0
3496,able to play with it tonight I will do the lay in bed and go through every possible setting thing.It is amazing .,1
3497,Already had a moment when my hands were too busy to unlock my phone wow that sounds nasty typing it and I was able to swipe with my knuckle and unlock with eyes.This thing is nice Black Package Disabler Pro or a similar app should be able to do it in as long as it takes to install the app .,0
3500,No it doesnt have a user replaceable battery as the back is non removable like the Note 5 .,0
3501,If you want one of those you would have to look elsewhere as Samsung seems to have abandoned the idea for their higher end phones .,0
3503,As a former ups driver I can tell you we know exactly when were delivering any phonelaptopelectronic .,0
3504,All apple products come from the same regional shipper and would actually prompt for a signature and state that an apple product is inside .,0
3505,When you have 8 of the same size same weight signature required package delivered next day on your vehicle its pretty simple to assume its the new galaxy .,0
3507,Good thing I dont live in California or I might have just got cancer.NOTE Lately reddit seems reluctant to recognize sarcasm or jokes .,0
3509,To think 2 years ago the largest issue was phones were bendable Having to reluctantly trade in my note 7 for a pixel XL .,0
3510,I would prefer to have a note but I wont be eligible for another upgrade when the time comes for the 8 to come out .,0
3511,Just a shitty situation for Note 7 victims all around ... Samsung has to pull out all the stops thats for sure Rumors are saying that theyre doing away with the flat screens to make the curved screens the signature feature .,0
3512,Prior to the Note7 I would agree .,0
3513,But I really think they perfected it with the Note7 .,1
3514,I go no case and have pretty much 0 accidental hits at this with itturning it in this weekend .,0
3515,Can only imagine it will get better from here on out Yeah would like edge to edge just have non curved screens .,0
3516,The key to having an edge phone is the case .,0
3517,Ive had zero unintentional edge hits when I have the case on .,0
3518,I definitely do have unintentional edge hits without a case .,1
3521,I have the same problem with my s7 .,0
3522,If they make the s8 like that Ill probably go with the Google Pixel instead .,0
3523,Get the F version of any device they produce its always unlocked and completely open .,1
3525,ex SM N910F Note 4 SM G935F S7E .,0
3526,The International Note 7 was SM N930F RIP .,0
3527,Samsung has no real reason to go with OLED to be honest .,0
3528,Super Amoled is the go to for Samsung due to Super Amoled being superior to Oled itself .,0
3529,Hence the Note 7 display .,0
3530,A ton of lightning going on spot on colors with 10 bit integration in the display and a contrast that would make an iPhone user cry .,1
3531,Yes please sell me a phone with potentially more shrapnel .,1
3533,There are a lot of other phones with built in batteries which are just fine .,0
3534,Yes Samsung will be fine .,1
3535,But I dont know about their smartphone division .,0
3536,This could really hurt them big time .,0
3537,Everytime someone flies goes on a train ect they will hear Note7 dangerous for the next year .,0
3538,I could easily see the Galaxy brand be permenantly hurt .,0
3539,At that point Samsung may decide to put less emphasis and investment in the mobile division and concentrate on their chip fab .,0
3540,Samsung may be on the same level as Sony HTC Moto ect and no longer the clear cut 1 Android brand .,0
3541,They already lost their crown in China and this will probably lose their crown to Google in the USA .,0
3543,Itll put investors on edge and high pressure on future products .,1
3546,So thats what they are doing with all those note 7 s pens Cortex A72 and A53 are mobile chips developed by ARM.I dont know how it would fair against intel since most chromebooks use Intel Celeron .,0
3547,Not going to lie this looks awesome .,0
3548,This would be so good for uni ... Any other features this has that the Note 7 had ... .,1
3549,That design is so hot right now .,1
3550,Hows the ehem battery life ... Might just scratch my s pen itch Fuck another device I dont need but will probably purchase .,0
3552,I wonder which one is better .,1
3553,There goes my entertainment budget for the next year ... Samsung has had a pro line for their tablets and computers for a while no .,0
3555,Ive never been a fan but Ive never had a curved edge phone .,0
3558,The fingerprint I would expect to be faster and of course when you have muscle memory to just do it from older phones .,0
3559,I think once you get used to using the scanner it will be more efficient .,0
3560,Like your muscle memory will position it right after a while and you will get used to swiping to unlock that you wont notice it as you do now with how you are just starting to use it .,1
3561,I assume in the next models they will have a more efficient way or even with updates that will make the iris scanner faster to use than to swipe the screen .,0
3564,at Best Buy if you pay the seven bucks to have them do it every time they fuck up they get a new one at no extra charge .,0
3566,Left is Black Onyx Right is Silver Titanium .,0
3567,Why get one when you can get two D A durability review on randroid shows it as far more susceptible to scratches which is an immediate turn off .,0
3568,Curved screens and screen protectors dont go well together .,1
3570,I have mutual respect for both systems and I must say Mashable sucks .,1
3571,Theyre very biased towards Apple and attempt to be hipfunny but as you can see here it doesnt work well .,0
3572,Oh this shit right here .,1
3573,Stop reading it .,1
3574,Be happy .,1
3575,A company using emojis in their wording and youre surprised that what they say is irrelevant Pretty sure theyre being tongue in cheek Apparently if you light your device on fire it gets burned .,0
3576,I think Mashable is running out of shit to say Wow this is dope and creepy lol .,0
3577,Yeah it completely caught me off guard .,0
3578,I wasnt expecting my watch to respond before my cat did or that my watch would respond at all lol Maybe in the States .,0
3579,In Asia the return system is nearly non existent .,0
3580,There are thousands of these bombs in peoples hands and Samsung is refusing to help them .,0
3581,Wouldnt it be a device issue since its part of the phone.How are we defining device .,1
3582,No thats not the fucking lesson .,0
3583,The lesson is dont release a half baked product without caring that it might endanger someones life.Tons of phones out there with non removable batteries that wont explode .,0
3584,Its a miracle no one died yet because of this although some kid got his face burned a few days ago .,0
3585,I agree with everything on your list aside from the cloud sync .,0

3637,Also should stay away from looking too iOSy I preordered my phone and gifted it to my brother because hes in med school there for 6 months before any of this nonsense the phone is a Canadian note 7 but its in the UK .,0
3638,Shipping is ridiculous because its a bomb so now most couriers are very cautious taking it on .,0
3639,Samsung UK wont help and Samsung Canada wants me to foot the bill for shipping .,0
3641,T Mobile at least will give you a complete refund and let you do whatever you want with the money to get something else .,0
3643,Bought mine with the preorder deal at sams club ... Called sprint ... was told to go to sprint store ... went to sprint store ahhh dont worry about it it was only like 40 devices plus nothing here .,0
3644,My response was news articles and legit concerns which sprint did not care about ... was then told to take it back to where i bought it and hope they had one in ... called sprint back ... confirmed i have to take it to sams ... why the fuck do i have to take it anywhere specific if this is such an issue .,0
3646,For something that is so dangerous carriers are making this way too difficult .,0
3648,BestBuy for example will trade it for an S7 or S7 Edge but wont let you return that for a Note 7 when theyre available .,0
3649,The phone is not under a recall as of yet .,0
3650,Its still considered a voluntary exchange .,1
3655,Att and t mobile sound like theyre not interested exchanging .,0
3658,So at one point I was walking around with three lithium batteries and one of them is a ticking time bomb .,0
3659,Wow Samsung just wow .,1
3660,Smh ... People dont learn giving money to the same bad company when they are so many better phones out there .,0
3661,iPhones Pixels HTC 10 V20 and lots of great decently priced phones like OP3 Axon 7 etc. .,0
3662,When you are buying Galaxy you probably dont care about software so lots of options .,0
3665,Be happy that you didnt get to .,1
3667,Im switching to the iPhone 7 because its the only phone Verzion has an Annual Upgrade program on so I can hop back the Note 8 in a year and Im so grumpy about losing the Note 7 .,0
3669,After my second note 7 I decided to switch to the 7 edge and if Im being honest I actually wish I got the edge to begin with .,0
3670,Its a work of art and the perfect size and while I miss the s pen I find the edge so much more comfortable to hold and use .,1
3672,I personally went to the Note 5 for the time being .,0
3673,I had the edge and I felt like the edge was almost too ... edgy .,1
3675,Its a great phone .,1
3676,Much less lag than the note 7 and I actually prefer the screen .,1
3677,The main thing youll miss is the software features and SD card .,0
3680,I wont be getting the S7E .,0
3681,I used it as a loaner between N7v1 and N7v2 and I didnt like the edges .,0
3682,Its a fast phone and does great but with the S8 to be announced in Feb Ill be turning in the N7 and waiting .,1
3683,The rumors sound like its going to be a great device.Its not like the S7E is any cheaper than it was on launch .,0
3684,I work retail and I notice most people exchanging for the edge 7 i wish i could just get my s6 back since i only had like 180 in payments left .,0
3685,I went with the LG G5 and waiting for the LG V20 Exactly what my gf just did .,0
3686,Not like the people are all of a sudden smart .,1
3687,I got the S7E only because they didnt have the iPhone in Stock and I was sick and tired of exchanging phones ... .,0
3688,How did you get it for 420 Im looking for a cheap phone to get me through the year between now and the note 8 .,0
3689,Im considering a oneplus 3 because its 400 but a pixel xl at 420 might be too tempting ... .,0
3690,That sucks .,0
3691,I usually wait a month or so to get a device .,0
3693,I got a note 7 2 days later I get an email from Verizon to tell me about a shipping delay due to battery issues .,0
3694,I waited got it as soon as it was rereleased .,1
3695,Then this crap kept happening .,0
3696,Guess Im opting for an iPhone 7 for now I bought a used S4 for 90 bucks and Im gon na use that till I can get a Pixel XL .,0
3697,Me and Samsung are taking some time off to ree,0
3700,The official recall for the Note 7 is a 100 credit if you get another Samsung phone .,0
3701,I doubt youll see any more than that since the recall is Samsungs fault and not your carriers .,0
3702,Meanwhile your phone will continue to become outdated as all support is dropped .,0
3703,Why would they have a freaking limit on the number of users who could participate on the beta .,0
3704,Isnt more users equal more feedback thus more better software in the end .,0
3706,This is kind of dumb .,0
3707,I couldnt find it in the galaxy store until noon today uCoffeshots Update last night I checked the updates for my phone and I am now running android 7.0 Theres ways to flash a version of the beta if youre willing to try .,0
3708,I registered and got in ... One mate go on now i just deregistered for you youre more of a samsung fan than i am I tired too ... Ive just registered for it hopefully I get in I want to wait for the Pixel but i was loving the Gear VR I got .,0
3709,So I guess im going to have to for the S7 or the S7 Edge if i want to keep using it .,0
3710,Just recently the the Gear VR wont work for the Note 7 anymore Typed from My Grenade Doubt theyll ever sell it again .,0
3711,Yea essentially Samsung S8 remove the galaxy naming5 .1 inch screen no S pen .,0
3713,Samsung S8 Pro5 .7 inch screen S pen .,0
3714,Based on the Note 7 chassis.I know they insist on 3 flagships this year and 4 last year S7 S7 Edge amp Note 7 for 2016 .,0
3715,S6 S6 Edge S6 Edge Plus amp Note 5 for 2015 .,0
3716,because they want at least a new flagship phone every 2 financial quarters but at this point they need to revise their strategy to devote all resources to knock the S8 amp S8 Pro out of the park for the entire financial year instead.To me the S6 Edge Plus amp Note 5 are as redundant as the S7 Edge amp Note 7 .,0
3717,If the iPhone 7 Plus has to be competed against it would be phones based on the Note 57 chassis not S6 Edge PlusS7 Edge chassis.In my opinion .,0
3718,Ugh DAD How did the numbers get thrown off .,0
3719,Uhhh ... people can use VR .,0
3720,It wasnt limited to the Note .,0
3721,Youtubers will celebrate .,1
3725,I will wait for next week for the new n7 to arrive .,0
3728,I went in to the shop I got my phone today to hand in my note 7 and order replacement I got told I wont recieved it until October 23rd .,0
3730,It would be nice to know if they would ship new Note 7s to those who already turned theirs in .,0
3732,Not allowed on work property at all .,0
3734,Edit Sorry misread your comment .,0
3735,Yea probably trying to stay ahead of the iPhone launch but thats probably not possible anymore lol Lol you spent 25 minutes with someone that barely speaks English.Thats about 24 minutes longer than Id have waited .,0
3736,You want your orders to get screwed up .,0
3737,Cause thats how that happens .,0
3740,keep calling their customer service and complain about it .,1
3742,Thats the date theyre saying for replacements but it is also the date to get one if you dont already own .,0
3743,This is actually very helpful news will make my job easier by evading them motherfuckin constant returns while we do the iphone 7 at the same time .,1
3745,Pretty sure theyve had bigger things to worry about ... They said something like 97 of phones Note7s sold in the US are affected Just got mine today .,0
3749,I made the plunge about 4 months ago now or so ... It was a constant back and forth for the first few days of hating it and loving it but I LOVE ANDROID .,0
3751,Apple has made some very bad choices in iOS and phones .,0
3753,If you do end up disliking this phone I would recommend the pixel just because it will give you the same feel .,0
3754,But the s7e is such an amazing phone and I love it.DO NOT FORGET TO SET UP AND USE SAMSUNG PAY .,1
3755,The only people that are negative are the ones the had the Note7 before .,0
3756,I had the not a loved it .,1
3757,Then I got the edge and you know what .,1
3758,Its an incredible phone .,1
3759,it doesnt make a huge difference in the happiness of my life but so what .,1
3760,I have a lot of things in my life that make a big impact toward my happiness I just wanted a new phone and it subsequently has made me happy to have a new phone .,1
3761,A google phone probably would give me the same feeling a Nokia 3310 would have probably given me an even better feeling come to think of it .,0
3762,If you want more of a Vanilla feel to your Samsung device download Nova Launcher and Good Lock .,0
3763,Having owned every Nexus phone except the 6p the S7 edge is the best phone I have ever owned .,1
3764,Tried Sony HTC LG UMI .,0
3765,Just picked up a used Note 5 and kind of liking that also .,1
3766,Welcome to Android where everyone hates Samsung .,0
3768,If you like Samsungtouchwiz features such as pop up Windows Samsung pay wireless charging and many others plus you want a micro sd card slot then Samsung phones are better .,0
3769,But if you prefer the stock Android feel more timely updates less noticeable lag then the pixel is better .,0
3770,It really more preference than which is better Bullshit .,1
3771,Got mine fixed days ago depends on where your repair depot is .,0
3772,Do not keep your keys and phone in the same pocket Welcome to the club .,0

3779,You can buy from https www.clove.co.uksamsung galaxy note 7Stock wont be available until end of October however .,0
3782,Best Buy actually allowed us to start selling again about a week ago Was in an international flight with Delta last week and the first warning we got was to not charge any Galaxy Note 7 during the flight cause of high risk of fire .,0
3785,Thats what I have been waiting on .,0
3786,I missed the smart watch promo and Ive been kicking myself because of it .,0
3787,If they dont die by then .,0

3847,Best Ive experienced in a smartphone Ive about 20 of them .,1
3849,It is a perk of the job haha It saves energy because to turn on entire display just for time which is done roughly 150 times a day drains about 28 percent battery .,0
3850,This always on saves you doing so and in turn saves you energy I knew this gon na be happen one day though little late but since Apple has fierce following its not easy to defeat it .,1

3867,People fangirl over new devices but forget that 1 year later those same phones are going without software updates and running old android versions .,0
3868,Look at least years Galaxy S 6s ... Only just got Android 6 AFTER Android 7 came out .,0
3869,Samsung is an awful company .,0
3870,Regardless of this thought if he returned the phone he would have no evidence of the phone blowing up in the first place Thats an S6 edge .,0
3875,Will this higher storage option make its way to the major US carriers .,0
3877,If they take away microSD ... even with a 256GB option ... Would welcome this greatly .,1
3878,I think they need the spec for Chinese market and just to tout they have a 256gb variant like the iPhone .,0
3879,Id be happy with 64 or 128 plus micro SD.Cant see them returning to no SD card after the s6 debacle and the sheer popularity of the s7 line .,0
3881,Sometimes the price bumps for extra storage arent so outrageous and then there is Apple who is 100 for every tier .,0
3882,Im big on SD cards myself and dont really want a phone without one if i can help it but I would pay extra for more superfast storage in addition to SD cards if its reasonable and not a gouge.It would be nice to see if the S8 gets a basic storage capacity jump since iphone 7 has 32GB now .,0

3927,This is the real low light comparison.S6 top S7 bottomhttps imgur.comEBRvjIs except its not .,0
3928,the exposure lock was clearly taken in two different spots resulting in a different exposure where the S6 has blown out the highlights.the only way this experiment would have been fair was to set the camera in manual mode and match the values between the two phones .,0
3933,I got ta say one thing .,1
3934,The glass over my note 5 and s6 are terrible at getting oil on them .,0
3935,Every time I go to take a picture I have to wipe off the glass or itll look like the photo here .,0
3936,What Im getting at is o think the s6 had an oily film over the glass when this was taken because thats how mine looks when it has oil on it .,0
3938,Holy crap the camera is amazing in low light and its crispy af outside .,0
3940,S7 top S6 bottomhttp imgur.comlo3NlFb To be honest stereo speakers are not on my list to improve.Got a s6 and while I would like an improvement on that one speaker stereo isnt a big deal.I only use it for YouTube or other short video for music I use ear plugs wired or bt speakers.If they can fit descent stereo speakers without removing anything sure why not but I wouldnt want to swap anything present right now for them .,0
3941,Samsung wont add those because theyre useless ... Who cares about that kind of speakers when you have a audio jack or Bluetooth speekers .,0
3942,Besides who the hell listens to music directly from the phones .,0
3945,Theyve listened to consumers for the last few years .,1
3946,They brought back micro SD card support water resistance they made the phone thicker for a bigger battery and slimmed down TouchWiz .,0
3947,As long as they continue to listen to consumers and think rationally I think theyll keep the headphone jack .,0
3949,Phone speakers are going to sound like absolute tinny garbage even if there are two of them .,0
3950,My S8 hopes 1 .,0
3952,Seriously if companies like Xiaomi can have a 4050mAh battery for their own Note phones that cost much less Samsung should go all out .,0
3953,No one buys phone X because its 0.7 mm thinner than phone Y. 2 .,0
3954,More reduction of bloatware .,0
3955,I cant stand redundant apps like Camera amp Magnifier .,0
3956,For other apps that hardly people ever use like S Health or Samsung Gear DO NOT pre install them .,0
3957,If they need apps to sync with other devices like the Samsung smartwatch let them download them upon syncing rather than pre installing them .3 .,0
3960,The default apps amp settings visuals should take more cue from the Black Theme darker colors so less battery life is being consumed .,0
3961,Sure consumers can manually change to the all black theme but the average general public are somewhat too dumb for that .,0
3965,4GB RAM and disable the loading animations .,0
3967,_____________ Of course all that and VR performance and non exploding batteries would be enough to knock Apple of its spot .,0
3968,apple is garbagio mang .,0
3969,Im going to be so disappointed in Samsung if they remove the headphone jack .,0
3970,If thats the case I would just keep my s7 .,0
3971,stereo speakers plz no .,0
3973,They should work on keeping the phone from exploding and catching fire before worrying about speakers haha As far as Im concerned Samsungs brand has been permanently tarnished and I will not be buying a Samsung phone for the foreseeable future .,0
3974,Their handling of this disaster has been breathtakingly callous and stupid .,0
3975,That dude that breathed all that black smoke might get cancer and die decades earlier than he should.Hope he gets MILLIONS from Samsung .,0
3977,But making the same mistake that can cost peoples lives is almost unforgivable .,0
3978,Cheap ass phones deleted In the same boat here .,0
3979,Already gotten a few people Ive run into make comments like sure it wont explode etc. the s7 appears to be tarnished where I live because of this as well .,0
3981,To many people I meet Samsung now equals boom .,0
3982,Well the device has to be on in order for current to flow an the issue is something in the phone is heating up too much and causes failure .,0
3983,I assume theres too much current being drawn by the part that fails and either the battery cant handle it or the part gets so hot the battery fails and erupts .,0
3984,Probably will be permanent .,1
3985,Theres no 3 strike rule here .,0
3987,I have the S7 Edge and its been great .,1
3988,Not sure why this Note 7 has been such a disaster .,0
3989,The Note is usually very renowned because it has the best features of the Galaxy S in a bigger form factor and more refined software .,1
3990,The Note 7 is still that but clearly there was an issue in manufacturing and possibly even engineering in the battery .,0
3991,I do have insurance on the phone .,1
3992,I doubt Verizon will warranty this under their 14 day policy though .,0
3993,The phone works fine 100 and the drop really wasnt that bad .,1
3994,There was no damage done to the side trim and the case covers the back now .,0
3995,Ill just wait until something catastrophic happens before putting in a claim at this point .,0
3997,Maybe you can find a way to get it replaced with a back plate that doesnt have the horrendous Verizon tramp stamp .,0
4000,I pay much less than that for unlimited data .,0
4004,Im assuming mine only cracked since I heard the back glass isnt as strong .,0
4005,That phone is too expensive not to have a case on it If that were my phone I would activate the phone and leave it in the box until my case came in .,0
4006,Good luck on whatever you decide to do .,1
4010,That way you immediately get a brand new phone .,0
4011,If you wait you risk getting a refurbished replacement .,0
4012,Dude what happened Well thats a Q40 which make 328hpHow fast were you going.I doubt the magnet would hold up under heavy acceleration holding on to a large phone .,0

4017,I never really trusted those magnet systems especially with heavy phones.Bit off topic but I tried a ridiculous amount of car holders and they all had issues .,0

4023,It was missing a lot or features .,0
4024,The 3 I readily recall because I used them a lot on my Tmobile phones was scheduling messages the spam folder for texts and download booster .,0
4027,That would be completely unacceptable in most of Europe .,0
4028,Why are Samsung even letting them do those changes .,0

4057,If they had left a removable battery none of this recall b.s. would be going on .,0
4058,We would all be getting new batteries .,0
4060,They have not released any specific information about what the triggers are for the explosions .,0
4062,All phones that use lithium ion batteries have the potential to explode the other companies have better PR teams than samsung and can keep a lid on it when this happens .,0
4064,The number of phones with issues VS. The number released is ridiculously low statistically it makes no sense to have killed a good phone when they cant even replicate the explosions themselves .,0
