2,2,The S7 is a top phone .,3,Positive
3,3,Waiting for S8 If thats the only two phones you are looking at then S7 for sure.You wont see a massive difference in performance since there is no 10nm yet.But it you are wanting the best android phone experience there is alot of talk about Google releasing a new phone line called Pixel amd Pixel XL in October.Maybe wait to see if that is announced in October else go the S7.I suggest this because Google phones are updated and most secure android phones you will ever find .,1,Negative
4,4,I am in the same predicament .,1,Negative
5,5,I was gon na go with the note 7 I always wait for the storm to ride out as I call it the beta test and thankfully so .,1,Negative

12,12,It will be awesome and announced earlier .,2,Neutral
13,13,The s8 is reportedly going to be out Q1 or Q2 2017 depends if you can wait that long .,1,Negative
14,14,The s8 will be better than the s7 but the s7 is still a top notch phone I think really at this point the S7 has everything you need .,3,Positive
15,15,I personally went with the S7 Edge .,2,Neutral
16,16,But wireless charging water resistant great camera great screen its really the whole package .,3,Positive
17,17,Only thing lacking if you could even call it lacking USB C .,1,Negative
18,18,If you can just wait it out .,2,Neutral
19,19,The s8 will obviously be better and even if you dont like it you can get an s7 for cheaper by then I am with U.S. Cellular they are the only coverage in my rural area and they have a pretty limited phone selection .,1,Negative
20,20,They dont sell the Moto phones anymore which would be my second choice .,2,Neutral
21,21,Im waiting to see what the S8 will be like .,2,Neutral

28,28,I also ended up having to turn the AMOLED setting to basic to avoid hyper saturated colors it would be nice to have a slider so I can go somewhere finer grained than None to 150 extra saturation .,1,Negative
29,29,I miss USB C on the Note 7 also which is lacking on the S7 which makes connecting the USB cable a momentarily attention seeking affair.Honestly I really like Android better than IOS aside from the up front grind of getting everything customized and behaving I just cant take my mind off the build quality of the iPhones .,1,Negative
30,30,Two bad Samsungs in two weeks is a sour flavor .,1,Negative
31,31,Nirvana to me would be Android OS on an iPhone.For now Im going back to iPhone not because Im in love with the OS or the customer hostile attitude but just because I feel like I can have the thing for years and know that it wont explode or shatter or mysteriously die without it at least being under a better warranty than mail it in and wait 2 weeks while we find a way to blame you.Assuming youre not concerned about the build quality then the S7 is a fine phone .,2,Neutral

38,38,I am in the same bloody boat .,1,Negative
39,39,Currently using Note5 wanted to get a Note7 when it came out but then the phones were recalled and whole exploding battery fiasco thing kind of scared me .,1,Negative

56,56,It has a bloody massive battery great screen micro SD card support IP68 water resistance etc. .,1,Negative
57,57,The S8 will most likely have the new iris scanner but honestly a finger print scanner is more practical and probably faster .,1,Negative
58,58,What Im saying is that the S7 difference from an S8 wont be that big especially when you previously used an iPhone .,1,Negative
