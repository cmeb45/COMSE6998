0,0,t mobile.comaccessoriessamsung note7 zagg invisibleshield dry full body.htmlthose are the ones i picked up at the store when i picked up the phone They actually say 80 chance of survival from 1.6 m high which is head height .,1,Negative
1,1,They claim its actually just the metal from the pick rubbing off .,2,Neutral
2,2,But yeah it seems its supposed to be more shatter resistant but more scratchable Oh man you do have me beat .,1,Negative
3,3,lols I have a line on mine this is my first high end phone I dont know what to do the crack isnt noticeable unless put above white background and can barely be seen unless you look at it from an angle I can feel the crack tho its a thin line across the screen .,1,Negative
4,4,I dont know what to do .,2,Neutral
5,5,Should I just buy a screen protector and put it on .,1,Negative
6,6,Because the crack is small and bare seeable .,2,Neutral
7,7,If you cant do without or think you want all the new s pen features I say its worth it .,3,Positive
8,8,Otherwise if you dont need a stylus go without .,1,Negative

10,10,Im thinking about getting it but I dont want to have overheating issues like the s6 since I do plan on getting the gear vr with it .,1,Negative
11,11,There is nothing the S7 Edge can do that the Note 7 couldnt .,1,Negative
12,12,The Note 7 is pretty much a slightly bigger slightly improved and slightly more refined S7 Edge with an S Pen.The difference is really only about 100 and not 200 like you stated talking about new .,2,Neutral
13,13,Its really a question of if you use S Pen or not.There just isnt enough differentiating feature and I wouldnt even say the price is that big of a difference between the 2 phones .,1,Negative
14,14,At least in the US the official unlocked version is 779 and Note 7 is 850 which is what the US unlocked version of Note 7 will cost once it releases in couple of months.What S7 edge costs 650 .,1,Negative
15,15,Are you talking about the international unlocked models without warranty .,2,Neutral
16,16,Samsung pay dont work etc.So its definitely worth 70 to 100 actual price difference .,3,Positive

18,18,Plus it still has some features the S7 doesnt have .,3,Positive
19,19,I heard the sound quality is improved thats a mouth to ear thing though.My justification of getting it is that I heavily used the pen .,2,Neutral

24,24,Feel in hand is second to none for me .,1,Negative
25,25,Got my 6p on Swappa .,2,Neutral
26,26,I wouldnt say so.More rigid build due to higher quality aluminum Gorilla Glass 5 Improved screen 50 brighter at max HDR compatibility Vastly improved UX S Pen Iris scanner a gimmick for most people USB C USB 3.1 Slightly larger screen and dimensions 100mAh smaller battery Less curved display Significantly better in hand feel Is a s pen worth 200 to you It depends on your use case .,1,Negative
27,27,The Note 7 is slightly more ergonomic in my opinion has fewer issues with palm rejection on the edge screen has the iris scanner as a security option and of course the greatly improved S Pen and the more fine tuned software that will be coming to the Edge later.If you feel like the S Pen and those few other features are worth it get the Note .,2,Neutral
28,28,If theyre not and you didnt use the Pen on your Note 3 get the Edge .,1,Negative

33,33,Nonetheless do you prefer bigger phones .,3,Positive
34,34,Would you use the stylus .,2,Neutral
35,35,Easily worth the extra 200 .,3,Positive
36,36,Bigger screen HDR Iris Scanner think about when your wearing gloves or you can not get to the finger print scanner USB 3.1 S Pen gorilla glass 5 better to hold in the hand better looking more future proof because its newer and will be supporting longer and more software features .,1,Negative
37,37,I would pay more for anyone of those but to add them all together is a bargain for 200 .,1,Negative
