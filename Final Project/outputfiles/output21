5,5,Smart TVs just sound like a hindrance when I can so easily replicate and surpass the experience offered by Smart TVs by simply buying a substantially cheaper high resolution non Smart TV and slapping a Chromecast on it.On a side note I find it funny that the site hosting this article employs some pretty annoying and intrusive ads as well .,1,Negative

76,76,This is because USB C cables are reversible .,1,Negative
77,77,EDIT The ridges are to help identify which side of the USB cable is up so that you can essentially plug in the micro USB cable into your phone without much effort .,1,Negative
78,78,As USB C cables can go in either way the design of the ridges are no longer needed .,1,Negative
79,79,Would look pretty weird with ridges on both sides and having it on one side would habituate people into plugging in USB C cables only one way .,1,Negative
80,80,In the short term its a bit of a mixed bag.On the one hand you have a reversible connector and you _ may _ have the USB 3 speeds.On the other you probably have a ton of micro USB cables and if you ever forget yours they are absolutely everywhere .,1,Negative
81,81,And none of those will work on the new phone.However it is expected that USB type C will replace the micro USB standard and if youve tried to find a mini USB cable lately you know just how much fun it is to be on the old standard once everyone is only carrying the new.Most Android flagships at the moment are using USB type C Samsung is the big holdout and it was a bit of a surprise that the S7S7 Edge were on USB micro instead of USB type C.Personally I think that the Gear VR was the only reason for that and doing a new Gear VR and USB type C on the Note this year makes the transition to USB type C on the S8 much easier .,1,Negative

86,86,Feels snappier ... This is the best tldr I could make original location data police warrants reduced by 95 .,1,Negative
87,87,Im a botgt Police routinely request location data from phone companies but the result is determined on the basis of the nearest cell tower which typically only provides a general estimate of a phone location.gt The better Google data is the more its ads are worth a strong incentive for continuing to collect and store exact location data.gt On the basis that Google ampquotCollects and retains location data from Android enabled mobile devicesampquot police requested all the location data between the phone activation and the date of Flowersamp039 arrest.So there is no monthly cost to be part of this program.Link to said program .,1,Negative
88,88,Bring this to the United States and I will be a customer hands down .,3,Positive
89,89,I love Samsung phones but god do the carriers des,2,Neutral
